GNOME War Pad - version 0.2.5
-----------------------------

This wants to be a help file, until I implement on-line help
on the program itself.

With this version of GWP, you can do the following:

[KeyPad +]: Zoom in
[KeyPad -]: Zoom out
[G]: Toggle grid.
[W]: Move up.
[A]: Move left.
[D]: Move right.
[S]: Move down.
[SHIFT+Mouse_Button1_drag]: Starchart panning.
[Mouse_Button1_click]: Select planet.
[Mouse_Button1_double-click]: Select planet and activate extra panels.
[Esc]: Deactivate extra panels.
[CTRL+Q]: Quit.
[CTRL+W]: Close game and return to the Game Manager.
