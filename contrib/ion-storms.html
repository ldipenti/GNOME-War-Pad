  <h1>Ion Storm Physics</h1>

  <p>Ion storm formulas are probably among the least known in the
   Planets community. So, like others sat down to reveal the exact
   population growth rules, I did my best to find out the Storm
   formulas. And because many people until now requested them, I
   decided to write them down here. Enjoy!</p>

  <h2>General</h2>

  <p>Ion storms are circular subspace disturbances that move rather
   randomly through the Cluster and affect ships. They are
   characterized by a <em>position</em>, <em>heading</em> (specified
   in degrees, like ship headings), <em>voltage</em> (strength of the
   storm, measured in MeV), and a <em>radius</em> (size of the
   disturbance in light years); and a storm can be either
   <em>growing</em> or <em>weakening</em>.</p>

  <p>Growing storms always have odd voltages, weakening ones have even 
   voltages. This means that adding one to the voltage changes the
   storm's status.</p>

  <p>Ion storms are grouped in classes, depending on their strength
   (voltage):
  <center>
   <table border>
    <tr><th>Voltage<th>Class<th>De-cloak?<th>Damage
    <tr><td align=right>0 .. 49 MeV<td>Class 1 (harmless)<td
      rowspan=3>Yes<td rowspan=3>No
    <tr><td align=right>50 .. 99 MeV<td>Class 2 (moderate)
    <tr><td align=right>100 .. 149 MeV<td>Class 3 (strong)
    <tr><td align=right>150 .. 199 MeV<td>Class 4 (dangerous)<td
      rowspan=2>Yes<td rowspan=2>Yes
    <tr><td align=right>more than 200 MeV<td>Class 5 (very dangerous)
   </table>
  </center>
 </p>

  <h2>Movement of Ion Storms</h2>

  <p>The speed of the storm is determined using the first matching
   rule of the following:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>In Host 3.22.003 and later, storms with more than 250 MeV
    always move at Warp 8.</li>
   <li>Storms smaller than 200 ly move at Warp 6.</li>
   <li>For other storms, a dice is rolled. The storm moves at Warp 2
    with a 20% chance, Warp 3 with 48%, and Warp 4 32% of all
    times.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The storm now moves, using the heading reported in the Ion
   Advisory messages, and the usual movement rules (travelled way =
   square of Warp).<p>

  <p>The heading for the storm to take next turn is random, between
   +10 and -10 degrees from the current heading. The new heading is
   reported to players. The reported Warp speed is worthless, at least 
   for the third category above: it will change until the storm moves
   next time.</p>

  <h2>Growing Storms</h2>

  <p>All storms start as growing storms, with an odd voltage. Each
   turn, the voltage increases by a random amount between 0 and 10
   MeV (in steps of 2). The radius decreases by 0..3 ly.  If a storm's 
   radius gets negative, the storm gets weakening by receiving one extra
   MeV; the new radius is then <code>1&nbsp;-&nbsp;Radius</code>.</p>

  <p>Growing storms may turn in to weakening ones. This is done by
   increasing their voltage by one. The chances for doing so are, in
   each turn</p>
  <ul>
   <li>1% (for all storms)</li>
   <li>2.5% if the voltage is more than 320 MeV</li>
   <li>10% if the voltage is more than 500 MeV</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that each storm gets <em>all</em> applying chances in
   series, so it can happen that a 400 MeV storm increases by 2 MeV
   because it ``won'' both the 1% and the 2.5% chance.</p>

  <h2>Weakening Storms</h2>

  <p>Each turn, the voltage is reduced by 4 to 14 MeV, in steps of
   2. Should the voltage drop to zero or less, the storm
   disappears.</p>

  <p>The documentation describes the <em>pancaking effect</em>. This
   happens at a chance of 3.33% per turn: pancaking storms have their
   radius doubled, and their new voltage is the square root of the
   original voltage.</p>

  <p>The storm size increases by a random amount between 0 and 10 ly
   each turn, after the above effects happened.</p>

  <h2>Ion Storms Merging</h2>

  <p>If two storms come close enough, they merge into one. If two
   storms are close enough for this is determined by the following
   formula:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>(x1 - x2)<sup>2</sup> + (y1 - y2)<sup>2</sup> &lt;
    (radius1)<sup>2</sup> + (radius2)<sup>2</sup></tt><br>
   Note that there is no real geometric interpretation for this
   formula. While the left side is the squared distance of the ion
   storm centers, the right side doesn't make sense. If we'd like to
   express that the storms just touch (like enemy minefields which can 
   touch, but not overlap), the right side had to read <tt>(radius1 +
    radius2)<sup>2</sup></tt>; if we'd want to express that one center 
   were inside the other storm, we'd compare to
   <tt>(radius1)<sup>2</sup></tt> and <tt>(radius2)<sup>2</sup></tt>
   in two equations. To cut a long story short, storms have to overlap 
   somewhat to merge, but they need not cover each other completely.</p>

  <p>In addition, one of the storms must be stronger than the other
   (greater voltage); two storms of equal power do not merge.</p>

  <p>Once we know that two storms merge, we have to compute the new
   position and size of the storm. It will keep the same Id number,
   warp factor and heading like the stronger of the two storms.
   The new center lies on the line between the two original centers,
   where<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>(new x) = x1 + (x2 - x1) * (voltage1) / (voltage1 + 
    voltage2)</tt><br>
   or, simplified,<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>(new x) = ((x1*voltage2) + (x2*voltage1)) / (voltage1 
    + voltage2)</tt><br>
   The formula for the Y coordinates is the same with Y instead of
   X. You may have noticed that this pulls the new center towards the
   weaker(!) storm, not towards the stronger one like one could
   guess.</p>

  <p>The new voltage of the storm is <tt>(voltage of stronger storm) +
    sqrt(voltage of weaker storm)</tt> (with <tt>sqrt</tt> = square
   root), likewise for the new radius <tt>(radius of stronger storm) +
    sqrt(voltage of weaker storm)</tt>. From these equations, it
   follows implicitly whether the new storm grows or weakens.</p>

  <p>Merging of storms happens after movement, but before the ship
   effects and before generation of new storms.</p>

  <h2>Ship Effects</h2>

  <p>Ion storms affect ships. All ion storms, no matter how
   weak, de-cloak ships. Only the advanced cloakers are safe from
   this.</p>

  <p>Storms with 150 MeV or more affect uncloaked ships.
   That is, only advanced cloakers can safely travel through such an
   ion storm -- cloaked.</p>

  <p>Ships are affected if they're inside the
   storm <em>after</em> the storm moved, but before they moved
   themselves (all Ion storm related things are quite early in the
   host order).</p>
  
  <ul>
   <li>Ships are pulled 75% if the way the storm travels. That is, a
    Warp 4 storm pulls ships 12 ly. This can be used for <em>ion storm
     surfing</em>: if your ship is heavy and/or experienced, or the
    storm is weak enough (but has at least 150 MeV!), you can move
    into the storm and have your ship pushed by it. This way, you can
    manage to travel more than 81 ly a turn. Ships move their 75% even
    when they're outside the storm afterwards.<br>
    Because ships are affected after storm movement, ships are pulled
    along the new heading, although the storm may have moved into a
    different direction.</li>
   <li>Ships are damaged: The damage taken is
    <tt>Storm_Voltage&nbsp;-&nbsp;Ship_Mass&nbsp;-&nbsp;Ship_Experience&nbsp;+&nbsp;20*(10-Ship_Engine)</tt>
    (in damage points, i.e., percent). This value increases by 50 if
    the ship doesn't have fuel.</li>
   <li>If the above causes the ship to take damage, it also loses crew:
    <tt>Storm_Voltage&nbsp;-&nbsp;Ship_Mass&nbsp;-&nbsp;2*Ship_Experience&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.3*Ship_Crew</tt></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that the <tt>Ship_Mass</tt> seems to be the mass of the
   ship <em>at the beginning of the turn</em>, that is, the same
   as it was in your last RST. So load your ships with cargo
   early, not in the same turn you enter the storm.</p>

  <p>Ships in an ion storm get experience. You get one experience
   point for every 20 MeV the storm has more than 140 MeV, that is
   storms with 160 to 179 MeV yield 1 experience point, 180 to 199
   gives two, and so on.</p>

  <h2>Other Effects</h2>
  
  <p>Storms outside the range (0,0)-(4000,4000) disappear the turn
   after they moved there. It is possible (though not very likely) to
   have storms at coordinates usually considered invalid: I already
   had a storm with a negative X.</p>

  <p>If there are more storms than the Host Configuration allows, the
   weakest ones disappear.</p>

  <p>Newly generated storms may have different warp factors reported
   (Warp 5 and Warp 7 are not possible according to the above
   rules). However, reported warp factors are worthless anyway as Host 
   re-computes them before actual storm movement. Up to three new
   storms can be born per turn.</p>

  <p>When I say <cite>random value between A and B</cite>, the border
   cases are less likely than the others due to rounding effects.</p>
