Description: A unit test framework for C
 Check is a unit test framework for C. It features a simple interface
 for defining unit tests, putting little in the way of the
 developer. Tests are run in a separate address space, so Check can
 catch both assertion failures and code errors that cause segmentation
 faults or other signals. The output from unit tests can be used within
 source code editors and IDEs.
