Mon, May 17, 2004: Released Check 0.9.0

Run fixture teardowns in reverse order to setup
Plugged some memory leaks.
Added test name to log outputs.
Applied patch (802160) for distcheck bug (579604).
Fixed log printouts for nofork mode.
Updated documentation and converted to DocBook.

Added a new print mode, CK_ENV, that gets the print mode from the
environment variable CK_VERBOSITY.

Made tcase_free and suite_free static. This may break existing test
programs. Everything is now freed when srunner_free is called.


Mon Oct 21, 2002: Released Check 0.8.4

Fixed pipe issues.
Allow to use check.h from C++.
Plugged some memory leaks.


Fri May 24, 2002: Released Check 0.8.3

Fixed various build problems. Fixed a problem with check.m4.
Documentation updates.


Mon Apr 15, 2002: Released Check 0.8.2

Added version information to headers and library. Added an autoconf
macro to easily integrate check into projects that use autoconf.

Removed limitations on line number, message and buffer sizes.

Declared constant string parameters as const.


Sat Mar 2, 2002: Released Check 0.8.1

Changed license to LGPL.

Fixed bug in running checked setup in nofork mode.


Wed Oct 24, 2001: Released Check 0.8.0

Support running in a nofork mode. Defined a checked fixture as well as
an unchecked fixture, support failing in checked and uncheck fixture
functions, and errors in checked fixture functions. Rewrote the
back-end to use pipes, rather than message queues.

Reimplemented printing functions in terms of string formatting
functions, to allow better testing of output without full end-to-end
testing.

Renamed some public constants to use the CK_ naming convention. This
will break existing test programs.

Documented the new features, and changed the distribution to include
sgml and html files, as well as lyx files, as many people don't have
lyx.


Thu Aug 23, 2001: Released Check 0.7.3

Fixed the Autoconf Lyx check in acinclude.m4 so that configure works
on Solaris systems (and hopefully others), and cleaned up a minor
problem in Debian packaging.


Fri Aug 17, 2001: Released Check 0.7.2

Automated RPM packaging, and included debian packaging. The makefiles
now has an rpm target (the RPMFLAGS variable can be set to add
additional flags to RPM). Debian packages are built the ordinary way
(dpkg-buildpackage).

Moved the example*.* files to tutorial*.*, since the docs really are
tutorials. Beefed up the tutorial docs to add clarity to the behavior
of fixture setup/teardown (based on a helpful critique by Fred Drake),
and to document the static nature of unit tests demanded by the bug
fix below.

Many bugfixes: added -Wall to the CCFLAGS for gcc, and fixed a mess of
warnings that resulted. Changed a bizarre naming mismatch in
tcase_set_fixture (masked by the lack of compile warnings), and made
unit tests static (both bugfixes suggested by Fred Drake). Also added
a more sophisticated test of Lyx to (hopefully) ensure that Lyx
supports linuxdoc (but it's not clear to me how to test that for
sure).


Wed Jul 30, 2001: Released Check 0.7.1

Reorganized printing and logging functions to allow for a less
primitive logging function. Logging is now documented in the tutorial
documentation.


Wed Jul 11, 2001: Released Check 0.7.0

Included a primitive logging function (at the moment, it only prints a
copy of the CRVERBOSE output to the log file), added the ability for
an SRunner to run multiple suites (and reorganized the Check tests to
take advantage of that), and added the magic to allow Check to be used
with C++.

Also added Doxygen markup to the header file, but I'm not terribly
satisfied withe clarity of the output. I may switch to CWEB... Next
release should include API docs and improved logging, if nothing else
comes up...


Wed Jun 27, 2001: Released Check 0.6.1

Bug fix for srunner_failures (bad version actually returned all
results), added srunner_results to do what srunner_failures used to
do, and added corrected unit tests for both.

Also changed the API for reporting the number of failed tests from
srunner_nfailed to srunner_ntests_failed, to harmonized better with
new function srunner_ntests_run. This unfortunately may break some
unit tests slightly -- that's why the major release number is 0 :-)


Thu Jun 21, 2001: Released Check 0.6.0

Features improved unit test reporting options, more complete unit
tests, and end-to-end test, and a full API into TestResults
