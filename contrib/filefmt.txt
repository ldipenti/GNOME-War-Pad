                             File Formats and more


INTRODUCTION - THIS FILE IS FOR PROGRAMMERS ONLY
=================================================

Contents
---------

  This file contains descriptions of the file formats of the strategic
  play-by-email game VGA Planets(tm) 3 by Tim Wisseman, and of some 3rd
  party utility programs for that game. The file is meant as a help to
  programmers of new utility programs. I don't know where the programmers
  of existing utilities got their information from as I didn't find a
  file comparable to this one yet. I started from nothing with my hex
  editor and a debugger. If you don't want to do this too, here are my
  results. I just can't stand if there are files on my hard disk and I
  don't know how they are built up.

  Technically interested Planets players may also find one or another
  useful information.

  As stated above, this list was created with the famous "Trial and
  Error" method and doesn't claim to be complete and always correct.
  Entries marked with [V] were verified with Wisseman's PD programs (for
  example, VPCPLAY) and the host documentation or other "official" sources.
  I have not yet used all these files in my programs, sometimes I've only
  taken a few samples and compared them. Those are marked with [T]. If you
  can report success using such files, please do. This file also contains
  the official file format definitions for PCC, my client program, which
  are also marked with [V].

  Really unknown information is marked with ?, other works correctly in my
  daily use.

  Since early 2001, I have been member of the PHost group; and since early
  2002, I have a copy of the VPA source. Most information in this file is
  older; I did not walk through the sources and check everything. I think
  that's not needed anyway, looking at a program from the outside gets one
  a much better view, without obscure comments getting in the way ;-)
  However, for most new features (PHost 4.0), documentation in this file is
  written together with the implementation and can be considered
  authoritative.

  I do not guarantee for anything. If you mess up your game with this
  information, it's your fault. If you get an unfair advantage using this
  information, you're a .... (sorry, I don't know English curses ;-)
  and should be kicked out of the Echo Cluster. Anyway, do you want to
  play your turn with a Hex editor?

  This file now uses the Latin-1 character set. Most of it should be
  standard US-ASCII, but we need special characters to spell Akseli's
  name correctly :)


On Cheating
------------

  This file is not meant as a cheating guide. Though the Wisseman Host
  (THost for short) implements some cheat checks, there are still some
  major loopholes. Most client programs won't let you exploit them, but
  this file is for writers of new such programs. Please, play by the
  rules. What to consider "rules" is left to your common sense.

  If you want fun and challenge, play honest. If you want to cheat,
  play other games. Single-player Descent with BIGRED cheat comes to
  mind ;-)

  Older hosts often send you data you should not have. Nowadays, it is
  generally considered legal to make use of this information, as "official"
  and "white hat guy" programs (Winplan, EchoView) let you access it. The
  rationale is you should no longer use these ancient hosts (pre-3.2).


Basics
-------

  This section contains some basic assumptions I make throughout the file.
  If you don't know them, the descriptions may be ambiguous, so do read
  this part.

  All original VGA Planets(tm) programs are written in BASIC. This, and
  the implementation of Planets, has an effect on the used data types:

  + Character strings are, if not stated otherwise, stored in BASIC
    format. This means, they are padded with spaces and stored without a
    length byte. Some programs will include the trailing spaces when
    interpreting the value, some will not. At least for names it probably
    makes most sense to trim trailing spaces.

  + Most fields are WORDs (2 bytes) and DWORDs (4 bytes). BASIC doesn't
    allow BYTE fields in files. All values are signed, little-endian,
    two's-complement integers unless specified otherwise. Most values are
    limited in range. If there's no limit specified here, assume 0..10000
    for WORD data and 0..1000000000 (10^9) for DWORDs (TRN file check in
    host, client-side data may be more "flexible").

  + BYTEs (characters) are unsigned, if not otherwise noted. This is the
    default interpretation in BASIC and Turbo Pascal, in C you should
    explicitly cast to `unsigned char'. Checksums generally are the sum
    of a memory block interpreted as a series of such unsigned bytes.

  + In BASIC, pointers into files count from 1, not 0 as in most other
    languages. This list uses the standard convention (starting with 0,
    decimal offsets). However, to use a pointer read from a Planets file
    (RST, MDATA, etc.), you have to code something like `Seek(Pointer-1)'
    in Pascal or C.

  + If there's an array with 500 elements and the description talks about
    "the ship", use a Ship-ID as index into the array. This is similar for
    Planets and Starbases, and for arrays with 11 elements and races. Note
    that with Host999 ship arrays are often split, one part containing
    the 500 "standard" ships, and one with the 499 "extra" ones.

  + Except for messages, high-ASCII characters should be avoided. In
    names, they are permitted but not displayed in PLANETS.EXE; and
    depending upon the client program used, they are interpreted using
    a DOS (cp437) or Windows/Unix (latin1) character set. In FCodes
    and passwords, high-ASCII characters are not allowed.

  + In string literals, control characters are shown using their decimal
    value. For example, `"CCsim",26' is the literal "CCsim" followed by
    character 26 (Ctrl-Z in this case). In addition, we use CR=13, LF=10.

  I assume you're familiar with common programmer's terminology. I use
  a Pascal-like notation:
    DIV               integer division (17 DIV 5 = 3)
    MOD               remainder (17 MOD 5 = 2)
    /                 float division (17 / 5 = 3.4)
    FOR i:=1 TO 10    for(i = 1; i <= 10; i++) in C
    ARRAY[0..9] OF X  an array containing 10 elements with index 0 to 9

  I have also prepared an "appendix" to the File Format List, which
  contains a few notes about how to implement all this, and pointers
  to free implementations. You get this file at the same place you got
  this list from, or <http://phost.de/~stefan/filefmt.html>.


Specialties
------------

  Some programs interpret the file specs quite liberal, partly due to the
  fact that they have never been officially published. Here are some
  specialties you may or may not want to take care of:

  + `Owner' fields on ships/contacts may be 12, if the `Jumpgate' add-on
    is used. PCC also allows you to use player-12-owned ships in a
    simulation, PHost allows to set a player to `race 12', giving a
    totally unspecial race (although there is never a thing such as
    `Player 12'). Some simulators generate `vcr12.dat' which they hand
    to VCR.EXE.

  + The Dominion computer player often generates zero-terminated ship
    names, not space-padded ones. This results in junk being displayed
    after the actual ship name. The "peng" shiplist compiler will also
    do this when needed with specification files, to avoid checksum
    problems. You may want to add a bogon filter for item names and
    messages (which often cite ship names) to your program. Some PHost
    versions will also store some fields (VCR, Ufos) as zero-terminated
    strings.

  + Not all programs generate or evaluate the 10 signature bytes at the
    end of each data file.

  + If possible and practical, you should check ranges of variables before
    using them. I have already seen UTILx.DAT `General Object' records
    with five-digit Warp factors. When taking the documentation word by
    word, these do not violate any constraints -- as there are none. But
    such speeds are clearly not usable for computing the way something
    will travel this turn...


Special Thanks
---------------

  + to Franki, for PView, a killer app of which VPA is just a mere clone; and
    for decoding RESOURCE.PLN;
  + to Bart Dopheide, whose invaluable eagle eyes pointed out many mistakes
    here and elsewhere;
  + to Piotr Winiarczyk, for the original AUXDATA.HST information, and PHost
    wormholes;
  + to Akseli Mäki, for many close looks at small details;
  + to Tim Wisseman who likes the number 13. This has made decoding many
    files much easier to me.


Sections of this file
----------------------

  PLAYER DATA       files a player has on his hard disk while playing his
                    turn;
  TRN FILE          describes the TRN file format in all its variations;
  RST FILE          describes RSTs;
  HOST DATA         describes the files the Wisseman Host (and PHost 3,
                    though -- strictly speaking -- PHost is "3rd party")
                    uses to keep universe data and other information;
  FIXED DATA        files that are normally constant throughout a game,
                    such as the xxxSPEC files or name lists. These are used
                    by the host and the players;
  CHECKSUMS         lists all checksums you may need to update if you write
                    a player-side program;
  3rd PARTY         file formats of various 3rd party programs (not by Tim
                    Wisseman). If you wish your file format to be added
                    here, feel free to contact me. There's a client-side
                    section and a host-side section;
  FILE LIST         a list of file names and programs that own these files.
                    Comes in handy when debugging game directories people
                    sent you;
  FIELD LIST        provides a cross-reference about which property is
                    stored where.

  Note that the borders between sections are floating: what you consider
  a host file, I may list under `fixed' or even `3rd party'.

PLAYER DATA
============

  The "x" in names matches the player number (1 to 11). For a description
  of the two signatures see GENx.DAT.

  For starships, planets and starbases there is a .DAT and a .DIS file.
  The .DAT file contains changes made by the player. The .DIS contains the
  information as extracted from the RST file (.DIS = "discarded"???).
  MAKETURN looks for differences between these and makes a TRN file. The
  .DIS files are generally not modified during a turn, clients only modify
  the .DAT.


Winplan Shareware
------------------

  The Winplan Shareware version is technically nearly identical to the DOS
  Planets client. It creates DOS TRNs and unpacks only DOS RSTs. The
  Windows resource files (WPVCR.DLL, BMP/WAV directory) are used anyway, as
  are version 3.5 message files (MESS35x.DAT).


AUTOx.DAT - WINPLAN - Auto stuff [T]
-------------------------------------

 +0     WORD    ?
 +2 4000 BYTEs  500 records of 8 bytes each, for all planets
                 +0     WORD    1 = Auto Sell Supplies on
                                0 = off
                 +2     WORD    preferred mine count
                 +4     WORD    preferred factory count
                 +8     WORD    preferred defense count
+4002 10 BYTEs  ?
+4012 n BYTEs   Auto Waypoints (file format bug -- see below!)
                 +0   6 WORDs   1 = this auto waypoint is enabled
                +12   6 WORDs   Auto Waypoint X coordinates
                +24   6 WORDs   Auto Waypoint Y coordinates
                +36   6 WORDs   Missions (0=no change)
                +48   6 WORDs   ?
                +60 6x3 BYTEs   Friendly Codes
                +78   6 WORDs   Task number (0=none, or 1..10), see
                                TASKx.DAT.
                +90   6 WORDs   0 = delete this order if completed
                                1 = repeat


## Auto Waypoints

  Winplan allows to assign each ship up to 6 waypoints, missions and
  friendly codes for the future.

  The `repeat/delete' flag tells what to do if this order is completed
  (waypoint reached): if set to `delete', it is removed from the list.
  if set to `repeat', all tasks are shifted by one position, and this
  task is placed at the end of the list.

  Note that this file format is bogus. For each ship's Auto Waypoint,
  Winplan reserves 48 bytes (that is, ship #1's record is loaded from
  +4012, ship #2's record from +4060, etc.), though each record uses 102
  bytes. So waypoints for adjacent ship IDs overlap, with garbage being
  displayed in the auto waypoint window. This makes it impossible to
  specify auto waypoints for ships with adjacent Ids, and even if the
  Ids are two apart, you're not safe.


## NAUTOx.DAT

  There's a patch to avoid the above problem. It changes the auto task
  storage to proper 102-byte records, starting at +4012. The file name
  is changed to NAUTOx.DAT.


BDATAx.DAT - New Base Data [V]
BDATAx.DIS - Old Base Data [V]
-------------------------------

 +0     WORD    Number of Starbases
 +2   n BYTEs   Records, 156 bytes each
 +m  10 BYTEs   BDATAx.DAT: Signature 2
                BDATAx.DIS: Signature 1

One Starbase Record:
 +0     WORD    Base ID (=Id of planet with this base)
 +2     WORD    Owner (1..11, BDATA.HST: 0=no base at this planet)
 +4     WORD    Defense (0..200)
                One starbase defense unit costs 10 mc and 1 Duranium.
 +6     WORD    Damage (0..100)
 +8     WORD    Engine Tech Level (1..10)
+10     WORD    Hulls Tech Level (1..10)
+12     WORD    Weapon Tech Level (1..10)
+14     WORD    Torpedo Tech Level (1..10)
                Tech upgrades: going from Tech N to N+1 costs 100*N mc.
+16   9 WORDs   Engines in storage (for the 9 engines from ENGSPEC.DAT)
+34  20 WORDs   Hulls in Storage. Each race has up to 20 possible hulls it
                can build. These 20 words correspond to the 20 TRUEHULL.DAT
                slots. There's no possibility to store hulls a player can't
                build normally.
+74  10 WORDs   Beam Weapons in storage
+94  10 WORDs   Torpedo Launchers in storage
+114 10 WORDs   Torpedoes in storage
                All the "storage" fields can hold values between 0 and 10000.
                As of Host 3.22.031, these fields are not allowed to be
                increased without sufficient tech due to a bogus cheat
                check. That is, you can not unload high-tech torps from a
                ship to a low-tech base.
+134    WORD    Number of fighters (0..60)
+136    WORD    Id of ship to be recycled/repaired
+138    WORD    What to do with that ship:
                 0      Nothing
                 1      Fix
                 2      Recycle
+140    WORD    Mission (Primary Order)
                 0      none
                 1      Refuel
                 2      Max Defense
                 3      Load Torps onto ships
                 4      Unload freighters
                 5      Repair base
                 6      Force a surrender
+142    WORD    Type of ship to build (0=no build order, 1..20=index into
                above array)
+144    WORD    Engine Type
+146    WORD    Beam Type
+148    WORD    Beam Count
+150    WORD    Torpedo Type
+152    WORD    Torpedo Count
+154    WORD    0. According to CPLAYER.BAS, this is a fighter count. When
                building a ship this value is effectively ignored, that's
                why PLANETS.EXE puts zero in here. This field should
                _really_ always be zero, after the build as many fighters
                as shown here are destroyed with no compensation...


## Build orders

  To build ship parts, ammo, tech levels or starbase defense, clients
  subtract the required resources from the planet and increase the
  starbase storage.

  To build a ship, you must buy the required items into storage; host
  will subtract them again. The build order must either be completely
  specified or completely zero. Beam Type and Beam Count are either
  both zero or both nonzero, likewise Torpedo Type and Count.

  Costs for a starbase fighter are 100 mc, 3 Tritanium and 2 Molybdenum;
  configurable in PHost 4.0k+.


CONTRLx.DAT - WINPLAN - Checksums
CONTROL.DAT - Checksums
----------------------------------

## DOS Planets

  CONTROL.DAT exists once per directory, even for more than one player.
  Then it contains information for all players in this directory, all
  need to play in the same game.


## Winplan

  For each player a single CONTRLx.DAT file. Winplan can handle multiple
  games in one directory, and one game spread over multiple directories,
  as long as there are no race collisions (i.e., two times player 3 in
  the same directory won't work).

 +0 500 DWORDs  Checksums of all ships
                For each ship in SHIPx.DAT, the sum of all bytes in the
                ship record is computed. Positions of unavailable ships
                are undefined and contain parts of deleted files.
+2000   -"-     Checksums of all planets.
                The same for all planets in PDATAx.DAT
+4000   -"-     Checksums of starbases
                The same for all starbases in BDATAx.DAT
+6000   WORD    0 ?
--- Host999 Games ---
+6002 n BYTEs   apparently unused
+8000 499 DWORDs Checksums of ships 501..999. Not all these need to be
                present if the corresponding ships do not exist.

  The word at +6000 might be a side-effect when the file is created: To
  make room for 6000 bytes, do a `Seek(6000)' followed by some `Write'
  statement.

  If this information is incorrect, Planets doesn't show an error message.
  It corrects the problem, but only if the erroneous record is accessed
  from within the client program. MAKETURN aborts with the following error
  message if it finds any mismatch:
    "DATA ENCRIPT ERROR".
  (This typo has successfully hidden itself in all versions, from DOS
  Planets up to Winplan 3.52...)


FIZZ.BIN - Even more checksums
-------------------------------

  This file exists once per directory, even for more than one player.
  Then it contains information for all players. All must use the same
  Planets version (shareware/registered).

 +0  33 DWORDs  11 records of 12 bytes for each race. Undefined if this
                race doesn't play in this directory:
                 +0     DWORD   Checksum for ships, equal to the number in
                                GENx.DAT, increased by 667
                 +4     DWORD   Checksum for planets, equal to the number
                                in GENx.DAT, increased by 1667
                 +8     DWORD   Checksum for starbases, equal to the number
                                in GENx.DAT, increased by 1262
+132    DWORD   ? (probably unused)
+136 25 DWORDs  String 1 (encrypted, see below)
+236 25 DWORDs  String 2 (encrypted, see below)
+336    DWORD   Checksum. Equal to the sum of all DWORDs in the above
                strings, increased by 668 (a number having nothing in
                common with 13).

  The strings are encrypted as follows:

    VAR Character : ARRAY[1..25] OF CHAR;
        Value     : ARRAY[1..25] OF DWORD;

    FOR i:=1 TO 25 DO
      Value[i] := Ord(Character[i]) * i * 13;  { Ord(x) = ASCII code of x }

  This is a signature for the registered/unregistered version of Planets.
  For the Shareware version the strings have the values

  "VGA Planets shareware    "
  "Version 3.00             "  resp.  " V3.5 for windows        "

  The host checks the first line to identify the shareware version, hence
  3rd-party clients can put their own version number into line two (I have
  been told of some Autohost who rejects these; I believe the Autohost is
  in error here.) For registered players, both lines need to be equal to
  be identified as the same player. The strings are written to REG.LOG in
  each host run. They are also stored in PLANETS.EXE. No, I won't describe
  this here...

  If the values from PLANETS.EXE and FIZZ.BIN don't match, Planets
  refuses to run with the message:

    "Switching PLANETS.EXE program in the middle of a turn
     is not allowed. (blah blah) This is to prevent errors
     and cheating.".

  UNPACK doesn't create FIZZ.BIN. However, PLANETS.EXE will always
  create and update the file. MAKETURN won't run if FIZZ.BIN is missing
  and displays a rather long error message.


GAMESTAT.DAT - WINPLAN - Game Definitions [T]
----------------------------------------------

  This file is located in the WINPLAN directory and contains information
  on up to 8 active games. These are presented in the game menu.

 +0   8 RECORDs of 206 bytes each
                 +0     WORD    0 (?)
                 +2  11 WORDs   The races being played by the player. Each
                                WORD is -1 if the race is played, 0
                                otherwise.
                +24  80 BYTEs   TRN Download path
                +104 80 BYTEs   RST Upload path
                +184 20 BYTEs   Name of the game
                +204    WORD    0 (?)
+1648   BYTE    unused, contains garbage
+1649   WORD    Number of the game selected last in the menu (1..8)

  The unpacked game data is always in the WINPLAN\VPWORKx directory,
  where x is the sequential number of the record (1..8). There seems
  to be no indication what race you chose last.

  To figure out the race number, there are two clues:

  + try to open a game file (BDATAx.DAT for example). If you get a
    sharing violation, Winplan has that file open.

  + compare the files' modification times. The most recent ones are
    those Winplan used last.


GENx.DAT - General Information
-------------------------------

 +0  18 BYTEs   Timestamp (10 bytes date mm-dd-yyyy, 8 bytes time hh:mm:ss)
+18  88 BYTEs   11 score records of 8 bytes each:
                 +0     WORD    Number of planets, 10 points each
                 +2     WORD    Number of capital ships, 10 points each
                 +4     WORD    Number of freighters, 1 point each
                 +6     WORD    Number of starbases, 120 points each
+106    WORD    Player Id
+108 20 BYTEs   Password
                The password has 10 characters (padded with NULs). Each
                character of the password is decoded as follows:
                  VAR pw : ARRAY[0..19] OF BYTE;    { this field }
                      ch : ARRAY[0..9] OF CHAR;     { password }
                  FOR i := 0 TO 9 DO
                    ch[i] := Chr(pw[i] - pw[19-i] + 32);
+128    BYTE    unused
                This field may belong to the password data. If you define
                an array of size 20 in BASIC, this field really gets 21
                elements (0 to 20). The password only uses 0 to 19.
+129    DWORD   Checksum of SHIPx.DAT/DIS
+133    DWORD   Checksum of PDATAx.DAT/DIS
+137    DWORD   Checksum of BDATAx.DAT/DIS
                These checksums are the total sum of all bytes of the
                appropriate files (i.e., count word, data, and signature
                block of both files).
+141    WORD    13 if the password has changed, 0 else
+143 10 BYTEs   New password, if any: each byte is increased by 50
+153    WORD    Turn number
+155    WORD    Checksum of the time stamp = sum of bytes at 0 to 17

From this data, a file signature is constructed:
+118 10 BYTEs   (second part of password data)
                Signature 1 is these 10 bytes.
                Increase the first byte by 1, the second by 2 and so on.
                The result is Signature 2.


## Note on passwords

  Passwords are padded with NULs, not spaces. High-ASCII characters are
  not allowed in passwords and should be treated as NULs: MASTER sometimes
  generates those.

  The password "NOPASSWORD" disables the password query.


INIT.TMP - Player List
-----------------------

  Congratulations, Tim Wisseman! You have fooled me with this file name for
  several weeks! This file has a name of a temporary file but isn't one. It
  contains 11 WORDs that are 1 if information for that player is available,
  and zero otherwise. PLANETS.EXE will not read the directory, it will
  trust this file.

  Of course, this file exists once per directory.

MDATAx.DAT - Received Messages
-------------------------------

 +0     WORD    Number of messages
 +2 n*6 BYTEs   Records of 6 bytes each
                 +0     DWORD   Address of message in file + 1
                 +4     WORD    Length of message in bytes
 +x   y BYTEs   undefined, or the messages

  The messages texts are encrypted: each ASCII code is increased by 13dec.
  A single carriage return (ASCII 0Dh, encrypted 1Ah) is a line break.
  Empty lines are stored as a line break only (no spaces). Messages do not
  need to be all of the same length. Messages from Winplan clients may have
  additional encrypted linefeeds (ASCII 0Ah, encrypted 17h) after the CRs.

  Characters with an ASCII code above 242 can't be encrypted in messages.
  The encryption does not have a "wraparound" (then, 250 + 13 would be 7).
  Attention: Planets doesn't check this and exits with an "Illegal
  Function Call" message. Host knows about this problem and replaces
  the characters with ASCII 13h (encrypted 20h = " ").

  Expect messages of at most about one kilobyte each: see under MDATAx.DAT
  for host-side size limits. Of course, _real_ programs don't have
  arbitrary limits.


## Message Type Codes

  From Host 3.20 and PHost 2.6c onwards, received messages normally start
  with a header like this (PHost does this consistently since 3.3c):
    (-xy000)<<< Headline >>>
  The headers were introduced to allow sorting the messages in Winplan.

  The hyphen identifies this message as a message from the current turn. If
  there is an "o" instead, it's an older message because the player has
  missed some turns.

  "x" specifies the type of the message. "y" is a race number, and "000"
  a planet or ship id. The following list shows the existing message types
  (in the following list, capital letters are variable, the rest is fixed):

    (-90XXX)    Race-specific mission (Hiss, Dark Sense), XXX is a planet
                Id.
    (-a0XXX)    Message from 3rd-party add-on, see below.
    (-afile)    TKF File transfer. See below.
    (-c0XXX)    Tim Continuum attacking planet #XXX. XXX is zero for ship
                attacks and priority points.
    (-d0XXX)    Ship or starbase built at planet #XXX.
    (-dRXXX)    Ship of race R (1..9, a, b) surrendered at base #XXX.
    (-e0XXX)    Emergency call from ship #XXX.
    (-f0XXX)    Ship or planet #XXX has been destroyed or captured.
    (-g0000)    HConfig.
    (-h0000)    External message (see MESS.EXT), usually from the host
                (SENDMESS); may also read `(-h000)'.
    (-i0XXX)    Ion storm #XXX.
    (-l0XXX)    Minefield #XXX laid.
    (-m0XXX)    Minefield #XXX scanned/swept.
    (-n0XXX)    Intercepted enemy messages: ship #XXX ran on a mine, or
                planet #XXX being pillaged/RGAed.
    (-p0XXX)    Message from planet #XXX.
    (-pRXXX)    New native life, overtaxed, or bad climate at planet #XXX.
                R is a native race (0..9) or "c" for colonists.
    (-r000)     Anonymous message.
    (-rX000)    Message from race X (0..9, a, b).
    (-s0XXX)    Message from ship #XXX. #XXX is zero if the ship no longer
                exists (glory device).
    (-t0XXX)    Terraform status from planet #XXX.
    (-uXXXX)    Message about UFO #XXXX (this type is not generated by
                host. Currently, only PCC evaluates it, but other authors
                are encouraged to use this, too, as it allows a nice and
                consistent interface for messages associated with an UFO.
                PHost uses it for wormhole messages since 4.0e/3.4h).
    (-w0XXX)    Ship #XXX ran on a web mine.
    (-x0XXX)    Explosion on long range sensors (#XXX = sequential number
                of explosion).
    (-y0XXX)    Meteor on planet #XXX.
    (-z0XXX)    (Bio-)scanner report from planet #XXX.

  Some Ids can be longer than 3 characters: (-l) and (-m) on PHost 3.3 with
  CPNumMinefields>=1000, (-u), possibly (-a) and (-x).

  Note that some message types allow both planet and ship Ids in the "000"
  field (codes `f' and `s' are known to do this). I suggest trying to link
  the message to a ship first, and if this fails, to the planet.

  Generally there are exactly as many (-f) messages as there are VCRs.
  Knowing this may make it easier assigning these messages to objects.


## Add-on Messages (-a0XXX)

  For messages starting with "(-a0XXX)", Winplan displays a the file
  WINPLAN\BMP\VPAUXxxx.BMP in the message reader. Those pictures are not
  transferred with the RST file; players have to install them in advance.
  Tim assigns Id numbers.

## VPA Data Transmission

  VPA data transmissions are normal player-to-player messages where the
  message body looks like this:

    <<< VPA Data Transmission >>>

    OBJECT: Planet 555           <--- Object & ID
    DATA: 1234567890             <--- Checksum in ASCII
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa    <--- Data
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

  Two data characters form one byte. "a" stands for 0, "p" for 15: the
  value of the byte encoded by two characters is 16*(second char) + (first
  char). Line breaks are inserted after 40 columns (20 bytes).

  The checksum is a 32 bit number, encoded as a signed decimal figure.
  The lower 16 bits are the size of the data block in bytes, the upper 16
  bits are some kind of checksum:

    { let this array contain the characters of the message, i.e. the
      'a' to 'p' letters, but not the headers or the linefeeds: }
    VAR bytes : ARRAY[0..nchars-1] OF BYTE;

    sum := 0;
    i := 0;
    WHILE i < nchars DO BEGIN
      X := 256*bytes[i+1] + bytes[i];
      sum := 2*sum + X
      i := i + 2;
    END

  (nchars is the number of characters in the message, i.e. two times the
  number of bytes to encode) This checksum effectively only depends upon the
  last 16 bytes of the text to be encoded, that is, the last 32 characters
  of the message.

  Note that the characters are case-insensitive for the decoder, but not for
  the checksummer. 'A' means the same as 'a', namely the digit 0, but has a
  different value for checksumming.

  The decoded blocks read as follows:

--- Planet ("OBJECT: Planet 123") ---
 +0     WORD    Turn number
 +2     WORD    Turn number
 +4     WORD    Owner of planet
 +6  81 BYTEs   Contents of planet record at offset 4 (Friendly Code), see
                PDATAx.DAT for description. Unknown values are set to -1.

                 Bit 14         1 = No starbase
                 Bit 15         1 = Starbase present

 +6     BYTE    horizontal text justification (0=marker is to the left of
                the text, 1=center, 2=right)
 +7     BYTE    vertical text justification (0=marker is below the text,
                1=center, 2=above)

+12     BYTE    Length of comment text
+13   n BYTEs   Comment text

  For lines, relative lengths are given. The line goes from (X,Y) to
  (X+dx,Y+dy).

--- RST Password ("OBJECT: Password 3") [V] ---
 +0     WORD    Turn for which this password is valid
 +2     BYTE    Password length
 +3  10 BYTEs   Password (unused places are filled with garbage)
+13     BYTE    Sender (number of player who sent this message; the number
                which is also in the OBJECT: line)
+14     BYTE    Receiver (who may use this password)
+15     WORD    Permission flags (currently unused, set to 0)

  This record can currently only be used with PCC. The password is not
  encrypted: the hex encoding can be broken with a calculator, as can
  the password in the GENx.DAT file, so there would be no point in
  protecting the password more.

  This record enables the specified receiver to open the sender's RST
  without having to know the password. Such a transmission is only valid
  for one turn. The transmitted password must match the sender's current
  password.


## Informer Alliance Information

  Informer (and other tools, such as EchoView) can transfer information
  about a player's planets and starbases to allied players. These messages
  contain in the body:

    Allied Planets                       <-- Signature
    Passcode : 17                        <-- Passcode (optional)
    506 69 105 770 809 350 390           <-- Id List
    405 908

  The Id List contains Ids of all the player's planets, each of which is
  increased by 500 if the planet has a starbase. The above information
  thus says, `the sender has a starbase on planet 6, he owns planets 69
  and 105, he has a starbase on #270, etc.'.

  Note that such messages are easy to fake, so use them with care and do
  not blindly accept them from anyone. Since the message text does not
  contain the originator race, you shouldn't forward such a message to
  anyone: it is of no use for them. The `Passcode' line may be missing.
  If present, it specifies a passcode both allies must have agreed to
  (a number between 1 and 9999).


## VPHost Binary Data Transfer

  VPHost's data transfer messages contain in the body

    <<  VPHOST Binary Data Transfer  >>
    80E300000010004586560235F6C6162702645646
    5627164796F6E602020202020202020202458656
    0264564637020202020202020202020202645646
    020202020202020202

    When you read this, run either VPUNPACK
    v2.20 or higher, or VPUTIL v2.50 or
    higher to process this message.

  Each line is up to 40 characters long and encodes 20 bytes. A message
  contains up to 13 lines with binary data. Two characters encode one
  byte, using normal hex digits. The only non-standard thing is that the
  less-significant nibble comes first (!), so the above example starts
  with the bytes 08h, 3Eh, 00h, 00h.

The decoded data block reads as follows:
 +0     BYTE    Type of block
 +1     WORD    "num" Number of bytes in this message, 1 to 253.
 +3     WORD    Offset into target file. If one block was split into
                multiple messages, the first message contains the first
                253 bytes (offset=0), the second one contains the next
                253 bytes (offset=253, because we already have 253), and
                so on.
 +5     WORD    Index. Zero unless otherwise stated.
 +7   n BYTEs   actual data ("num" bytes)

  + Type 6 Block: HConfig (see HCONFIG.HST);
  + Type 7 Block: VPConfig (VPHost's configuration file);
  + Type 8 Block: Race name. Index is the race number, data contains the
    3 race names (30 bytes long, 20 bytes short, 12 bytes adjective = 62
    bytes total).


## TKF File Transfer

  A TKF file transfer message looks like this:
    (-afile)< FILE: kfvcr5.dat  [1/1] >
    1'Z+!p!K"!]RJ5!"ga&!fh;H&*=/%!!!!!!7T^oQ
    [!!!!1\)-&*=/%!!!!!!h"81&H!!!!1\)-&*=/%!
    !$!!!h"81&H$<rr1\)-&*=/%!!!!!!h"81&H!!!!
    1\)-&*=/%!!!!!!h"81&H!!!!1\)-&*=/%!iX/cn
    ...
  The header line tells you what file it is, and whether it was split;
  the body of the message contains the file in radix-85 encoding.

  In radix-85 encoding, five characters encode four bytes; therefore, each
  line encodes 32 bytes. The encoding works as follows:
    { let code[1] to code[5] be five characters from the message.
      L is an (unsigned) 32 bit variable. }
    L := 0
    FOR i:=5 DOWNTO 1 DO
     L := 85*L + (Ord(code[i]) - 33);

    { now, L contains four bytes }
    data[1] := L AND 255;
    data[2] := (L SHR 8) AND 255;
    data[3] := (L SHR 16) AND 255;
    data[4] := (L SHR 24) AND 255;
  Note that this method will always generate files whose size is divisible
  by four; there is no way to encode "odd" sizes.

  These messages are used to transmit "KFVCRx.DAT" files to players.


MESSx.DAT - Sent Messages
--------------------------

 +0     WORD    Number of messages
 +2 50*10 BYTEs records of 10 bytes each, for all messages:
                 +0     DWORD   Address of message in file + 1
                 +4     WORD    Length of message in bytes
                 +6     WORD    Sender (= Player Id, otherwise the host
                                rejects it).
                 +8     WORD    Addressee (race number 1..11, 12=for the
                                host: will show up in host log and
                                HOSTMESS.TXT)
+xxx  n BYTEs   First message. Encrypted, see MDATAx.DAT.

  The message encryption is the same as in MDATAx.DAT.

  PLANETS.EXE starts the first message at offset +502, leaving room for 50
  message headers. PCC dynamically moves the messages, leaving at least
  50 free slots.

  Messages should end in a line break (CR, encoded as 26): when HOST.EXE
  dumps host messages to the HOSTMESS.TXT file, it will not write a proper
  linefeed after the message, so messages may accidentally run together.


## Message Size Limits

  THost limits the size of a TRN file "SendMessage" command to 700
  bytes. PHost limits messages to at most 18 lines of 40 characters each
  (after breaking long lines).

  Both hosts prepend a signature line ("(-rX000)<<< Subspace Message >>>"),
  a "FROM:" and a "TO:" line, and (THost only) a blank line.

  The file format would allow messages of up to 32 kByte per message, but
  since (a) the host prepends some headers, and (b) received messages
  must be smaller then 32 kByte, you can't completely exploit this
  capability, even if your host would allow to.


## Messages to many

  Messages to many races, such as Universal Messages, are stored as several
  single messages, one per addressee. The Client program (PLANETS.EXE/PCC)
  inserts the headers ("<<< Universal Message >>>"), not the host. It
  should not be problematic to have multiple message headers refer to the
  very same message text, but so far no program is known to do that.

  If you want to collapse multiple identical messages together when reading
  in MESSx.DAT, you may want to care for the header lines:

  + Universal Messages start with "  <<< Universal Message >>>" (two
    spaces!).

  + VPA starts its team messages with "  <<< Team Message >>>" (again,
    two spaces).

  + PCC's messages to multiple players start with "CC: other_addressees",
    or "<CC: other" if the sender and receiver are the same (to avoid
    triggering the PHost command processor). The address is either a
    full race name or a space-separated list of player numbers and the
    word "Host".


MESS35x.DAT - WINPLAN - Sent Messages
--------------------------------------

  Winplan uses this file instead of MESSx.DAT to send messages. Sending
  messages to several people is supported by the file format, but Winplan
  does NOT insert header lines like the DOS clients as Planets and PCC do
  ("<<< Universal Messages >>>"). MAKETURN disassembles messages into
  single commands.

 +0     WORD    Number of sent messages
 +2  17 BYTEs   ? (unused, rubbish)
+19   n RECORDs containing the messages. Probably, a variable record size
                is possible, but not supported by Winplan:
                 +0     BYTE    unused fill byte
                 +1     BYTE    Flag. If the message is valid, this byte is
                                31h ("1"). If the message has been deleted,
                                the value is 30h ("0").
                 +2  12 BYTEs   Addressees, a list of 30h ("0") and 31h
                                ("1") for all 11 races and the host.
                +14     WORD    Length of message text. In my files, the
                                value is always 600.
                +16   n BYTEs   Encrypted message.

  The message encryption is the same as in MDATAx.DAT, except that line
  breaks contain both a CR and an LF (0Dh 0Ah, encrypted 1Ah 17h). The
  message is padded with encrypted spaces (2Dh, "-"). The THost line-break
  filter is not aware of the additional 0Ah's, so a line must not be
  longer than 39 characters in a Winplan message.

  If a message is deleted, Winplan doesn't truncate the file but copies
  all messages back some positions and sets the flag at the first invalid
  message to "0".

  If the file is empty (no message has been sent yet) it contains a single
  zero word only.

  Possibly, a variable record size is planned though not implemented in
  Winplan. Since 600 bytes is too less for a message, PCC can extend the
  format in this way if it knows Winplan is not installed: Winplan itself
  would crash reading the file.

  Winplan uses the Windows Editor Control. This is a full editor capable of
  doing automatic line breaks. CR/LF is only in the text if one has really
  pressed ENTER. If you have written down a complete paragraph, it will
  contain no single CR/LF, line breaks were only done at display time.
  This was "downgraded" in later Winplan versions (i.e., ENTER is required)
  and a host-side filter adds linefeeds after 39 columns.

  Winplan uses an ad-hoc conversion for Latin-1 characters (Windows) to
  MS-DOS characters (cp437): "translate German letters". This conversion
  is neither perfect nor complete, so best avoid it.


### VPA

  Internally, VPA can only handle DOS-style message files (MESSx.DAT).
  When it starts up, and MESS35x.DAT is more recent than MESSx.DAT, it
  converts the Winplan messages into DOS format. Likewise, when it
  exits, it converts MESSx.DAT back into MESS35x.DAT. This will break
  up messages to many people in the appropriate number of unicast
  messages.


NOTESx.DAT - WINPLAN - Notes [T]
---------------------------------

 +0 500 RECORDs of 200 bytes each: Notes for planets.
                 +0  100 BYTEs  Note #1
                +100 100 BYTEs  Note #2

                 +0  200 BYTEs  Note
 +? 500 BYTEs   ?

 +? 499 RECORDs of 200 bytes each: Notes for starships with Ids >500.
                 +0  200 BYTEs  Note
                This field starts at offset 302200 with the note for
                starship #501.

  The notes are space-padded and can contain CR/LF. This file is
  extraordinarily large, that's why I omitted the 6-digit offset fields
  here.


PDATAx.DAT - New Planet Data [V]
PDATAx.DIS - Old Planet Data [V]
---------------------------------

  This file contains all your planets, and all unowned planets you are
  orbiting (those for which you can request a mineral survey).

  Up to Host 3.14, you were getting PDATA records also for planets owned
  by enemies. This is problematic because they contain the friendly code,
  which current client programs, including recent Winplans, will happily
  display. Stealing minerals, sailing minefields -- it never was easier :)

  Up to PHost 3.4c, PHost was zeroing the fields Colonists, Supplies,
  Money, Mines, Factories, Defense, Colonist Tax, and Native Tax when
  you were scanning an unowned planet. Thus, the value zero actually
  means "don't know", not "zero".

 +0     WORD    Number of planets
 +2   n BYTEs   Records of 85 bytes each
 +m  10 BYTEs   PDATAx.DAT: Signature 2 -> GENx.DAT
                PDATAx.DIS: Signature 1

 +9     WORD    Number of factories (0..~416)
+11     WORD    Number of defense posts (0..~366)
                The ranges are based upon the maximum population of 10
                million colonists (100000 clans). The maximum number of
                mines on a planet is (COLON = colonist clans):
                  COLON                        if COLON <= 200
                  ROUND(200+SQRT(COLON-200))   if COLON > 200
                Replace 200 with 100 for factories, and 50 for defenses.
                When building structures, the client program must subtract
                the appropriate costs from the available resources (1
                supply, and 4/3/10 mc for mines/factories/defenses).

                        86..100 arctic  (0..14°F)
                In case you wonder why we store `100-F': originally, this
                was just a type code with no real-world equivalent. It was
                changed to mean a temperature with Host 3.20 and Winplan.
+83     WORD    1=Build base, 0 otherwise. The client program must subtract
                the starbase cost (900mc, 402T, 120D, 340M; configurable in
                PHost 4.0k+) from the available resources when setting this
                word to 1.

  The happiness change can be computed from the tax level and the other
  planet data. It corresponds to the value shown in PLANETS.EXE as
  follows:

     <= -6      Hate you
   -5 .. -1     Are angry at you
       0        Are undecided about you
   +1 .. +4     Like your leadership
     >= +5      Love you

  Formulas are different for PHost and THost.

  + Natives, THost:
    Trunc(500 + 50*SPI - 85*NativeTax - (Mines+Factories) DIV 2
              - Sqrt(Natives)) DIV 100
    ... plus 10 for Avians
  + Natives, PHost:
    Trunc(500 + 50*SPI - 85*NativesTax - (Mines+Factories) / 2
              - Sqrt(Natives)) DIV 100
    ... plus 10 for Avians
    (Note that the difference PHost/THost here is that THost uses integer
    division for industry effect while PHost does floating point).

  + Colonists, THost, Crystals with desert advantage:
    Trunc(1000 - 80*ColonistTax - Sqrt(ColonistClans)
               - (Mines+Factories) DIV 3 - 3*TempCode) DIV 100
  + Colonists, THost, other races:
    Trunc(1000 - 80*ColonistTax - Sqrt(ColonistClans)
               - (Mines+Factories) DIV 3 - 3*Abs(TempCode-50)) DIV 100
  + Colonists, PHost, Crystals with desert advantage:
    Trunc(1000 - 80*ColonistTax - Sqrt(ColonistClans)
               - (Mines+Factories) / 3 - TempCode/0.66) DIV 100
  + Colonists, PHost, other races:
    Trunc(1000 - 80*ColonistTax - Sqrt(ColonistClans)
               - (Mines+Factories) / 3 - Abs(TempCode-50)/0.33) DIV 100
    (Difference, again, is integer vs. floating point, and different
    handling of temperatures).


PATH.DAT - Game Directory
--------------------------

  The original DOS Planets clients stored the path they were last invoked
  with in this file. This is necessary for invoking the VCR, see
  VCRINIT.TMP below. This file contains only a usable name (i.e., ending
  with a backslash), no newline, no Ctrl-Z.

  This file can be safely deleted when no Planets program is running.


RN.DAT - WINPLAN - RACE.NM Treatment
-------------------------------------

  This file contains a single WORD with the value 0 if the race names
  from the RST should not overwrite the local ones. The WORD has the
  value -1 (FFFFh) or the file does not exist if the RST names should
  overwrite RACE.NM.

  This file lives in the game directory (VPWORKx).


SHIPx.DAT - New Ship data [V]
SHIPx.DIS - Old Ship data [V]

                even if 3rd-party missions are used.
+105    WORD    Money (0..10000)


## Weapons

  Like for build orders (BDATAx.DAT), beam type and beam count should be
  either both zero (meaning no weapon) or both non-zero. The same holds
  for torpedo launcher types and counts.

  Some programs (Dominate, I suppose), generate ships with a zero count,
  but a non-zero type (e.g., a freighter with 0 Mark 8 launchers). So
  you must check both fields to tell if a ship has weapons or not. The
  usual hosts and clients handle this correctly (if "correctly" means that
  they don't crash or do something unexpected). The bad thing about this
  problem is that it can not really be corrected from client-side. You can
  sweep it under the carpet by hacking the SHIPx.DAT/.DIS files during
  unpack, though, which is what PCC does. PHost 3.3 corrects this at host
  side.


## Cargo Transfers / Ship Mass / Jettison

  The ship mass is computed as the sum of the masses of all components
  of the ship (hull, weapons), ammunition, and cargo (fields at +43 to
  +73). Unload/Ship transporters do not contribute to the ship mass.

  Note that, however, PLANETS.EXE counts transporter contents toward the
  ship's cargo hold. That is, if a SDSF transfers 70 kt of something to
  an enemy ship, it is reported as fully-loaded by PLANETS.EXE although
  it has nothing in its cargo hold. Host 3.22.030 enforces this limit
  (earlier ones do not). Common 3rd-party clients (VPA, PCC) allow
  overloading the ship this way, as do earlier Hosts and PHost. Since
  3.22.036, this restriction is host-configurable ("VPA extra features"),
  and Winplan also allows overloading.

  When transferring cargo, you remove the cargo from the ship's own cargo
  hold by subtracting, and load it onto the target ship/planet or onto
  the transporter by adding it.

  When transferring stuff to an own ship, PLANETS.EXE often generates a
  dummy transfer (Id set, but all amounts are zero). These transfer
  orders should not be sent to the host, and can (should!) be canceled.

  When in deep space, ships can jettison cargo; this is a normal ship-to-
  foreign-planet transfer with the target planet set to zero. Most
  clients implement it this way. When the ship has no fuel, the transfer
  fails and the cargo is put back onto the ship.

  Winplan implements jettison by just subtracting the cargo from the
  ship's cargo hold, bypassing the transporter. This way, it can even
  jettison ammo and money. One can still tell how much was dropped by
  summing up everything of that cargo type at the particular place, and
  seeing how much is missing from the beginning of the turn (PCC
  implements such an algorithm for torps/fighters). Winplan does require
  the ship to have fuel to allow this, though, so the effective rules
  remain the same. PHost until 3.4g/4.0d supports this type of jettison
  only for Winplan-style TRNs, others (including Winplan shareware users!)
  will get a yellow status and PHost will undo the action.


## Missions

  THost reserves the mission numbers 0..19 for its own use and allows usage
  of missions 20..999 for add-on programs. THost requires the unused
  mission arguments (Tow, Intercept) to be zero if a standard mission other
  than Tow/Intercept is used. It also imposes some limits on the arguments
  for add-on missions: the intercept argument must be a valid ship Id
  number or zero. If these constraints are violated, arguments are cleared
  or missions are not performed.

  PHost uses missions 20 and up for extended missions (defaults, the base
  number can be changed). PHost (up to 3.3b) requires the mission arguments
  to be in the range zero to 500, even if the mission would allow more
  (e.g., beam transfer money): larger values are flagged as Yellow status
  when processing the turn, and are set to 250. Values outside this range
  can be set with 'extmission' commands. Newer PHost versions allow the full
  range 0..10000 for mission arguments.

  The interface to enter extended (i.e. code >= 20) missions in Winplan
  is known as M.I.T. (Mission/Intercept/Tow) and can be configured with
  MISSION.INI.

  Standard Missions:
    0   none
    1   THost/PHost: Explore.
        SRace: that what is mission 9 in "normal" hosts.
    2   Mine sweep
    3   Lay mines

SHIPXYx.DAT - Ship coordinates
-------------------------------

  For each ship a record of 8 bytes. Ships that are invisible or have not
  yet been built are stored as location (0,0). The file ends with
  Signature 2. These ships are visible on the starcharts, though not
  necessarily scannable (see TARGETx.DAT).

  Generally, this file contains an XY entry for every ship in the
  SHIPx.DAT, TARGETx.DAT, and KOREx.DAT files, and possibly more. Allied
  targets as sent by Host 3.22.039 do not have a corresponding entry,
  though.

  For a standard host, this file contains 500 records (4000 bytes, plus 10
  for the signature), Host999 uses 999 records (7992 bytes plus signature).

  Note that if Host999 is not used but the RST was unpacked with
  Winplan999 or Unpack999, this file will have 999 entries, but the last
  499 of them are garbage. These will have bad coordinates (e.g. X = 12592
  ($3130, "01", first two digits of timestamp)), but not necessarily bad
  owners. Praise Tim.

A ship record:
 +0     WORD    X position
 +2     WORD    Y position
 +4     WORD    Owner
 +6     WORD    Mass in kt


SKOREx.DAT - WINPLAN - Extended UFO Database [T]
-------------------------------------------------

  This file does not exist or has a length of 0 if the RST file had the
  version signature "VER3.500". For "VER3.501" RSTs, this file exists:

 +0  96 BYTEs   ? (unused)
+96   5 BYTEs   Signature "yAmsz"
+101    WORD    Total number of UFOs. Note that this file only contains
                UFOs with an ID number > 100, UFOs 1 to 100 are already in
                KOREx.DAT. If this field is 100 or less, no UFOs follow
                here. The host reduces the size of the UFO database, so if
                the highest existing UFO Id is 215, you'll find the value
                215 here, and 115 UFO records following.
+103    WORD    RST sub-version (currently 1, the "01" in "VER3.501").

+105  n RECORDs of 78 bytes each: the UFO records (see UFO.HST).
--- if "Total number of UFOs" <= 100 ---
+105  5 BYTEs   Marker "no000"


SNOOKER.DAT - WINPLAN - TempLock Deluxe
----------------------------------------

  SNOOKER.DAT contains timestamps for all active games, and maps these to
  a 11-DWORD block (44 byte) each. This is used for making TRN files.

  The file is located in the WINPLAN directory.

 +0     WORD    Number of the current entry (1..40), telling which of the
                timestamps was added last.
 +2  40 RECORDs of 18 bytes each, containing the time stamps of unpacked
                turns.
+722 40 RECORDs of 44 bytes. These entries correspond with the timestamp
                entries and contain random values.

  When unpacking a result file, Winplan checks if it already knows the
  time stamp and if not adds a record containing the timestamp plus 44
  random bytes to this file.

  When making TRN files, the Id block in the TRN will contain the
  corresponding 44-byte block. Winplan will neither load nor MAKETURN
  for games not "registered" here ("Game data is stale").


TARGETx.DAT - Visible enemy ships ("Contacts") [V]
TARGETx.EXT - VPUNPACK/VPUTIL - More enemy ships
---------------------------------------------------

  This file contains visual scan information for ships.
  + Host 3.00 packs many (all?) ships into this file, even those that
    can't be seen because they're orbiting a planet. Visibility is
    determined by PLANETS.EXE, via SHIPXYx.DAT (ships not in SHIPXYx.DAT
    are not visible).
  + Host 3.20 and later pack only ships you actually see here and in
    SHIPXYx.DAT.
  + Host 3.22.039's "FF allies" are only stored here, but not in the
    SHIPXYx.DAT file.
  Modern client programs (including Winplan and all 3rd party things) will
  happily display Host 3.00's "invisible" ships. They must do so, otherwise
  they would not support "FF allies" :-/

  The standard UNPACK program can't handle TARGETx.DAT files with more than
  50 targets.
  + in DOS-style RSTs, the host will put the 50 nearest targets here and
    drop the rest.
  + in Winplan-style RSTs, THost will put 49 targets here (no matter how
    far they are), and the rest goes in KOREx.DAT. PHost packs up to 50
    targets.
  + VPHost and PHost can be told to allow more than 50 targets in the
    RST file ("BigTargets"). VPUnpack will split the file into TARGETx.DAT
    (50 targets) and TARGETx.EXT (rest); PCC and CCUnpack can do that,
    too.

 +0     WORD    Number of ships
 +2   n BYTEs   Records or 34 bytes each
 +m  10 BYTEs   Signature 2

A ship record:
 +0     WORD    Id Number
 +2     WORD    Owner
 +4     WORD    Warp (zero if ship doesn't have fuel, no matter what its
                real speed is)
 +6     WORD    X position
 +8     WORD    Y position
+10     WORD    Type of starship hull (might differ from real ship type
                if the RacePlus Chameleon Device is used)
+12     WORD    Heading in degrees, 0=North, 90=East, 180=South, 270=West,
                -1=unknown (i.e., not moving)
+14  20 BYTEs   Ship name.

  Remote-controlled ships have the remote-control player in the Owner
  field, the original owner is marked by appending a signature such as
  '*2' to the name. UTILx.DAT contains this information in a more
  readable form.

  If PHost is used with AllowShipNames restrictions, and you are not
  allowed to see a particular ship name, the name will be 'Ship 345',
  where 345 is the ship Id, possibly amended with a remote-control
  signature. Otherwise, there is no sign saying whether the name
  you're seeing is the true name or not.


TASKx.DAT - WINPLAN - Auto Tasks [T]
-------------------------------------

  Winplan allows to define up to 10 tasks to be used with the Auto
  Waypoints.

 +0     WORD    ? (unused)
 +2   n BYTEs   10 records of 46 bytes each
                 +0  30 BYTEs   Name for this task

                All values may be negative to mean `beam down'.


TEMP.PLN - Temporary file
TEMP.BMP - WINPLAN - Temporary file
------------------------------------

  This file is left in the Planets directory by the Wisseman clients.
  It contains a piece of RESOURCE.PLN or WPVCR.DLL.

  This file can be safely deleted.


TEMPLOCK.DAT - Checksums
-------------------------

  This file is created by Tim's MAKETURN, and can normally be safely
  deleted.

  It contains 11 DWORDs containing the checksum block from the turn
  trailer.


UTILx.DAT - PHost - Information for Client Programs [V]
UTILx.EXT - PHost - Add-on Information [V]
--------------------------------------------------------

  The UTILx.DAT files are generated by PHost to allow client programs to
  get information in machine readable form, without parsing messages.

  PHost-aware add-ons can write their information to a UTILx.EXT file
  in the host directory, PHost will append that file to the final
  UTILx.DAT file. Note that UTILx.EXT is purely a host-side thing, it
  is never sent to players. Players only receive the final UTILx.DAT.

  During PHost processing, add-ons still see the old UTILx.DAT files.
  If you want to check something in such an add-on, you may try to use
  the UTIL.TMP file generated by PHost, see under the `Host files'
  section.

  In several records, PHost attempts to do you a favor in sending you
  "human-readable" values, namely
  + you often get a population count, not the number of clans like in the
    other files. Divide by 100 to get clans;
  + you get an actual Fahrenheit temperature, not the encoded value from
    the PDATAx.DAT file. Subtract from 100 to get a PDATA-compatible value.


## General File Structure

The file contains records of the following layout:
 +0     WORD    Type
                     0..40      used
                    41..16383   reserved for PHost
                 16384..16399   Torsten Czerny
                 16400..16431   Jens Hofbauer
                 16432..16447   Rafael Alvarez
                 16448..16479   Sven Bursch
                 16480..16511   Ingo Korb
                 16512..16639   Stefan Reuther
                 16640..32767   Available
                 32768..65535   Reserved
 +2     WORD    Number of data bytes following
 +4   n BYTEs   data

  The file begins with a control record (type 13). A program can use this
  record to check if the file corresponds to the current turn. PHost
  generated records follow in more or less chronological order. Finally, an
  End record (type 30) terminates the PHost information, after it follow
  records from add-on programs (UTILx.EXT).

  This file lists all known version dependencies, but you should not
  rely on them: to know whether a particular piece of information is
  available in your UTILx.DAT, check the actual record sizes, not
  version numbers. Records might grow in the future, so you should
  handle the size anyway.


## The records

--- Type 0 (Mine field) ---
 +0     WORD    Mine field ID
 +2     WORD    X
 +4     WORD    Y
 +6     WORD    Owner
 +8     DWORD   Mine Units
+12     WORD    Type (1=Web, 0=normal)
--- PHost 2.0+ (?): ---
+14     WORD    for own mine fields, ID of planet with friendly code,
                zero otherwise.
--- PHost 2.6d+: ---
+16     WORD    Cause of this report:
                 0      Mine field laid
                 1      Mine field swept
                 2      Mine field scanned

  The most current information comes last. If the player this minefield
  belongs to uses Winplan, non-existence of a `Minefield scanned' record
  means the minefield does no longer exist.

                 5      heavy           >= 150 structures
                (structures is mines + factories)

  Note that the value 5 here gives more information than there is in
  the actual messages. This is considered a (minor) bug and may be
  removed in the future.

  This record has been defined since PHost 1.3, but is not generated
  until 4.0j. There is at least one add-on (by Vladimir Babchuk) which
  also generates these records.

--- Type 18 (Colonize Mission) [PHost 1.3+] ---

--- Type 30 (End of PHost info) [PHost 2.7a+] ---
This record doesn't contain data.

  PHost sends this record as the last one in UTILx.DAT, before it
  appends UTILx.EXT.

                Note that the PHost specification file does not say
                anything about the format of these strings. By analogy with
                UFOs, one would expect standard BASIC strings (space
                padded), but the fact that PHost is in C speaks for zero-
                terminated strings. So, for a robust program, expect both
                types.
+74     WORD    Type code

+76   n BYTEs   optional additional information

  Note that it is definitely possible to receive two objects with the same
  ID, but different type codes, as it's quite hard to synchronize add-ons
  among each other. It is not quite clear if it's legal for an add-on
  program to generate two objects with the same Object Id and type code,
  which only differ in the info strings and in the additional information
  block. Most existing client programs (EchoView, PCC) will not handle
  this.

  This record is never generated by PHost; it is intended for use by
  add-ons.

--- Type 34 (File) [PHost 2.9d+] ---
 +0  12 BYTEs   File name

                 Bit 0  1=Text file, 0=binary
                 Bits 1..7 are reserved
+13   n BYTEs   File data

  This record type is used by PHost to transfer RACE.NM, PCONFIG.SRC and
  XTRFCODE.TXT, the results of the "send racenames", "send config" and
  "send fcodes" commands. It should not problematic for your add-on to
  use it for similar purposes.

--- Type 35 (Cloak failure) [PHost 2.10b+] ---
 +0     WORD    Ship ID

                 +0     WORD    Ship ID
                 +2     WORD    True owner. If the ship is in your
                                SHIPx.DAT file, you're controlling a ship
                                owned by this player. If it's a target,
                                you're scanning a remote controlled ship.
                                -1 for an own ship means remote control is
                                disabled for that ship.

  levels.


## Digests for specification files

  The control record (type 13) contains "digests" of the specification
  files, to help ensuring that both host and players use the same file set.
  These digests are kind-of a CRC, and are computed as follows:

  * first, initialize a table -- as usual for CRC calculations

    VAR crctab : ARRAY[0..255] OF DWORD;  { 256 unsigned 32 bit quantities }
        b, i   : BYTE;                    { 8 bit, unsigned }
        x      : DWORD;

    FOR b:=0 TO 255 DO BEGIN
      x := b;
      crctab[b] := 0;
      FOR i:=0 TO 7 DO BEGIN
        IF x AND 1 <> 0 THEN x := x XOR $10811;      { `$' means Hex }
        x := x DIV 2;
        crctab[b] := crctab[b] + (x+1) * $10811;     {*}
      END;
    END;

  * then, initialize a DWORD variable `digest' to zero.

  * now, for each byte `b' from the appropriate file, do

      digest := digest + crctab[(digest AND 255) XOR b] + digest DIV 65536

  * the result in `digest' is the required 32 bit digest.

  The computation of the digest uses the following parts of the files:

  * The "undefined" bytes at the end of the files are ignored. Only the
    parts which are actually needed are covered:
    - 6300 bytes of HULLSPEC.DAT;
    - 594 bytes of ENGSPEC.DAT;
    - 360 bytes of BEAMSPEC.DAT;
    - 380 bytes of TORPSPEC.DAT;
    - 440 bytes of TRUEHULL.DAT;
    - 682 bytes of RACE.NM.

  * The XYPLAN.DAT file is treated as if all owner fields were zero.

  * The configuration digest is a byte-wise checksum over the internal
    configuration structure of PHost. It depends on the endianness of
    the host machine as well as the padding. In PHost below 3.0, this was
    the PCONFIG.HST file; I believe there is no longer a real use for
    this checksum outside PHost in 3.0 and later.

    In PHost 3.4c and later, the configuration checksum covers the
    PCONFIG key names and values in text form, with whitespace and
    comments stripped. For example, when your PCONFIG.SRC contains
    "GameName = First Strike", the byte sequence "GameNameFirstStrike"
    is checksummed.

  Note: except for the line marked {*}, this is precisely a standard CRC
  (for a CRC-16, one would say `crctab[b] := x' after the inner loop). If
  you have more information on this code, please tell me.


VCRx.DAT - Visual Combat Recordings
------------------------------------

  A Visual Combat Recording is, other than its name implies, not a video
  recording. It's just a list of the starting parameters of the battle.
  The VCR program runs the battle using the same algorithm as the host.

 +0     WORD    Number of VCRs. For PHost, see below.
 +2   n BYTEs   Records of 100 bytes each
 +x  10 BYTEs   Signature 2.

A VCR record:
 +0     WORD    `init' Random Number Generator initial value.
                Host:    Must be in range 1..119. VCR's random number
                         generator uses a table of 119 "random numbers"
                         used in sequence and scaled to the needed range.
                         Host actually generates 1..111 (111 is very rare).
                PHost:   any value is possible.
 +2     WORD    Signature (first battle only):
                Host:    must be zero
                PHost:   must be `48879-init' (modulo 65536). Zero on
                         subsequent battles.
 +4     WORD    Host:    Temperature code of planet for a Ship/Planet battle
                PHost:   Capability flags (first battle only):
                          Bit 0    "Death rays"
                          Bit 1    "Ship experience levels"
                          Bit 15   Valid bit. If zero, the value of this
                                   word is undefined and should be treated
                                   as zero.
 +6     WORD    Type of battle
                 0      Ship/Ship
                 1      Ship/Planet
 +8     WORD    Mass of left object
+10     WORD    Mass of right object
+12  42 BYTEs   Left object (Ship)
                 +0  20 BYTEs   Name. Note that many PHost versions store
                                this field as a zero-terminated string.
                +20     WORD    Damage at beginning
                +22     WORD    Crew
                +24     WORD    Id Number
                +26     BYTE    Owner
                +27     BYTE    Host: zero (Host addresses +26 as a WORD)
                                PHost: race number, 0 if equal to owner,
                                or in older PHosts. This is used to ensure
                                that the VCR player knows the correct
                                value of the `PlayerRace' option.
                +28     BYTE    Picture. This field contains the picture
                                number (RESOURCE.PLN) only, palette
                                rotations as done by the Planets program
                                are not reported. So the Alchemy Ships look
                                exactly the same as a Super Transport
                                Freighter. The Nebula Class Cruiser usually
                                has picture #16. However, when it has
                                Transwarps (type 9), THost assigns it #30
                                for no apparent reason (easter egg?)
                +29     BYTE    Host: zero (Host addresses +28 as a WORD)
                                PHost: hull number of ship, 0 for planets
                                or in older PHosts.
                +30     WORD    Type of beams
                +32     BYTE    Number of beams
                +33     BYTE    Host: zero (Host addresses +32 as a WORD)
                                PHost: experience level of object [PHost 4
                                and later]
                +34     WORD    Fighter Bays
                +36     WORD    Torpedo Type
                +38     WORD    Number of Fighters/Torps
                +40     WORD    Number of Torpedo Launchers
                                See below for notes about this field.
+54  42 BYTEs   Right object (Ship/Planet). The same format as for the left
                one.
+96     WORD    Shields of left object
+98     WORD    Shields of right object


## Secondary Weapons

  The "Fighter Bays" (+34) or "Number of torpedo launchers" (+40) field
  determines whether a ship has fighter bays or torpedo launchers.

  If the player has set the `NTP' friendly code, hosts set these fields
  as follows:
  + THost: both are zero. However, the other fields -- torpedo type and
    ammunition count -- are set to their correct values(!);
  + PHost: PHost reports `NTP'ing ships as having the correct number and
    type of bays/launchers, but no fighters/torps.

  Thanks to Akseli Mäki for pointing this out.


## Planets

  A planet is always the second (right) object in a battle. In this case,
  the picture given in the VCR record is ignored. VCR uses a generated
  picture, see also description of RESOURCE.PLN. For this calculation,
  the planet temperature is needed.

  For planets, the Crew field indicates whether the planet has shields
  or not. If it is zero, the planet starts with 0% shields, otherwise
  the maximum possible value (100%).

  In PVCR, planets may have torpedoes and fighters, if the configuration
  says so. In this case, the fields at +34 and later are set as follows:
        +34     WORD    Fighter Bays
        +36     WORD    Torpedo Type
        +38     WORD    Number of Fighters
        +40     BYTE    Number of Torpedo Launchers
        +41     BYTE    Number of Torpedoes


## What VCR?

  A battle record is said to "bear the PHost signature" if the WORDs at
  +0 and +2 add up to 48879 as described above. Rumors claim that PHost 3
  also uses the value 65261, but I've never seen these in the wild.

  If the first battle bears the PHost signature, the file was generated
  by PHost, otherwise it was made by THost.

  Once you know you're dealing with a PHost VCR, you need to tell what
  version it is:
  + If the file contains only one battle, it's PHost 3 or 4.
  + If the file contains two battles, and the last one has owner fields
    zero, the player has used CORR (see below), and the file contains one
    PHost 3 or 4 fight.
  + If the last battle record contains a PHost signature and the "battle
    type" field is zero or one, it is a VCR.HST file. You can't tell the
    version from those.
  + If the last battle record contains a PHost signature and the "battle
    type" field is two or larger, it is a PHost 2 player VCR file and the
    last record is in fact the configuration record.

  PHost 3 and 4 can be told apart using the "Capabilities" field. That
  field contains a bitfield of features needed to play the file. The most
  significant bit must be set to tell that this field is valid; if it is
  clear, it should be treated as all-bits-zero. If there are capability
  flags set which the VCR player doesn't know, it can't play the
  recordings. PHost versions before 3.4d usually set this field to zero.
  PHost 4 combat with all capabilities zero is identical to PHost 3
  combat; they can't be distinguished.


## VPA & CORR

  VPA (up to 3.60e) has a bug: when it receives a PHost 3 VCR file with
  exactly one battle, it displays no battle at all. There is a program
  CORR.EXE which works around this problem by adding a dummy battle.
  This dummy battle can not be played. It can be detected because it has
  almost all fields -- in particular, the owner fields -- are zero.


## PHost Configuration

  PHost's VCR is configurable. That's why each VCR file generated by PHost
  1.x or 2.x contains a configuration record. The file contains one battle
  less than said in the header, the last battle record is the configuration:

 +0     WORD    Signature (random value)
 +2     WORD    Signature. This value plus the one at offset +0 gives
                48879 (modulo 65536).
 +4     BYTE    ("Temperature/Capabilities" field) Major version of PHost.
                If this is anything other than 1 or 2, you should ignore
                this record: PHost 3 and later never use it.
 +5     BYTE    Minor version of PHost
 +6     WORD    ("Battle type" field) Number of valid bytes in the following
                structure, 64 in all known versions (3.15.1.1 to 3.2.2.13).
--- Start of Configuration Structure ---
 +8     WORD    `BayRechargeRate'

--- End of Configuration Structure ---
+72   n BYTEs   unused

  PHost 3 relies upon the PCONFIG.SRC file and omits the "configuration
  battle". Due to the "arrayized" (per-player configurable) battle
  parameters, the parameters wouldn't fit in one battle record.

  The `PlayerRace' option is transmitted within each VCR, in the high
  byte of the Owner field: if an owner field is 0205hex, it names a
  ship owned by player 5 who plays race 2.


VCRINIT.TMP - Temporary file
-----------------------------

  This file is used for communication between PLANETS and VCR. More
  precisely, VCR can be run only if this file exists, otherwise it chains
  to PLANETS. PLANETS will ignore a password query if VCRINIT.TMP exists
  and load the given player's data immediately (nice, too ;-).

File Format:
 +0     WORD    Player Number
 +2     WORD    Signature 667 (29Bh)
 +4   4 BYTEs   0


## Invoking the VCR

  If a program needs to call VCR, it needs to perform the following steps:

  + Generate a VCRx.DAT. The signature may be missing, VCR doesn't perform
    integrity checks. GENx.DAT is not required.

  + Generate a VCRINIT.TMP containing the player number. It is possible to
    use player number 12 to avoid file name collisions. Generate a
    PATH.DAT that contains the path to be used (i.e., where you put
    VCRx.DAT and VCRINIT.TMP). The path must be usable immediately, that
    is, it must be possible to append a file name and use it ("D:\PATH\",
    not "D:\PATH").

  + Create a copy of VCR.EXE. Check locations 155A3h and 15828h. If they
    contain the strings "planets" and "PLANETS", you're dealing with the
    original VCR: patch in the 7-character name (without ".exe") of a
    program which just terminates itself; you need to supply this program.
    If the signatures are missing, don't patch. You're then probably
    dealing with a copy of PVCR.EXE or a compressed VCR.EXE, your patch
    would happily blast it into pieces. Alternatively, temporarily rename
    your program `planets.com', so VCR will execute that one when exiting.

  + Change to the Planets directory, otherwise VCR can't locate its data
    files.

  + Execute the VCR copy.

  + Delete the VCR copy and VCRINIT.TMP, and possibly the temporary
    program.

  Note that implementing a VCR manually is not that hard, so you may
  want to choose that alternative.


## Replacing the VCR

  This is harder, because the above method invokes hacking the VCR.EXE
  file. Ideally, your program would have to be ready-to-patch, but that
  can usually not be achieved.

  If you only want that your program be called when you hit the [V]
  button in PLANETS.EXE, use the following procedure:

  + Write your program as usual, but make it able to handle the PATH.DAT /
    VCRINIT.TMP conventions.

  + If your program finished, chain to PLANETS.EXE, passing it the correct
    path as argument. You can use a C function of the "exec()" family for
    this. Implementing such a function is tricky under DOS, so if you don't
    have it, an alternative is shrinking your program to a minimum stub and
    spawning PLANETS.EXE as usual, as a sub-process. Note however that this
    will fill up memory if the user invokes the VCR many times. Even this
    problem can be avoided by using some kind of a resident PLANETS.EXE
    loader, but it's probably not worth the trouble.


TRN FILE
=========

 +0     WORD    Player ID
 +2     DWORD   Number of commands. THost accepts no more than 5000.
 +6  10 BYTEs   Date of last turn: mm-dd-yyyy
+16   8 BYTEs   Time of last turn: hh:mm:ss
+24     WORD    unused
+26     WORD    Timestamp Checksum
--- only, if commands exist ---
+28     BYTE    unused
+29   n DWORDs  File positions of the commands, each increased by 1

Command:
 +0     WORD    Command Code
 +2   n BYTEs   Data

  A command is a request for the host to change a value. For example, the
  action "build a factory" is encoded as three commands:
  `PlanetChangeFactories', `PlanetChangeMoney' and `PlanetChangeSupplies'.
  MAKETURN looks for differences between the xxx.DAT and xxx.DIS files,
  and emits such commands.

  A TRN file does not contain a list of things you did this turn ("sell one
  supply"), it contains just the net effects. If you undo one action
  (e.g., raise taxes, then lower them to their original value), this is
  not reflected in the TRN file (here: no tax change command is generated
  at all).

  There are 4 groups of commands (values in decimal, not all numbers are
  actually used):

   1..19        Ships (SHIPx.DAT/.DIS)
  20..39        Planets (PDATAx.DAT/.DIS)
  40..59        Starbases (BDATAx.DAT/.DIS)
   >= 60        general (Password, messages - GENx.DAT, MESSx.DAT)

  THost rejects unknown numbers as "Unknown OPP" with a cheat warning, but
  no consequences for the player. PHost does not accept turns with invalid
  commands.

  The command names given below are these used in my UN-TRN program, you
  should recognize what they do from their names and arguments: The
  arguments are usually "snippets" from a player-side data file.


Identification of TRN files
----------------------------

  The last command is followed by a data structure. There are two types
  of such "trailers", one for Winplan, one for DOS.

  The structures are addressed from the end of the file (i.e.,
  `Seek(F, FileSize(F) - N)', that's why it's deadly to enlarge a TRN file.
  If the checksums don't match, Host tries to recover from a X-Modem
  transfer (which appends Ctrl-Z to files) by removing Ctrl-Z's. Windows
  TRNs with appended Ctrl-Z's are no longer recognized as such.


## Structure for VGA Planets for DOS

 +0     DWORD   Checksum `X'
 +4     DWORD   Contains random data with original MAKETURN. Some
                MAKETURNs put a signature here.
 +8 204 BYTEs   Signature from FIZZ.BIN (offset 136, the 2 strings + sum)
+212 11 DWORDs  Id block (see below)

  The checksum `X' is the sum of all bytes in the TRN file up to (but not
  including) this structure, plus 3 times the timestamp checksum, plus 13.

  If the TRN file doesn't contain any command, this block is located at
  position 28 in the file.

  Winplan Shareware is identical to DOS planets from this point of
  view and generates the same file format.


## Structure for Winplan registered

 +0   6 BYTEs   Signature "VER3.5"
 +6   2 BYTEs   Sub-version "00", "01"...
 +8     DWORD   VPH35 Value, part A
+12     DWORD   VPH35 Value, part B
+16  25 BYTEs   String 1, part A (Serial number)
+41  25 BYTEs   String 1, part B
+66  25 BYTEs   String 2, part A (Registration date)
+91  25 BYTEs   String 2, part B
+116 50 BYTEs   String 3 (Name of player)
+166 50 BYTEs   String 4 (Address of player)
+216 100 BYTEs  ??? (zero)
--- the DOS structure follows here ---
+316    DWORD   Checksum `X'
+320    DWORD   Contains random data with original MAKETURN. Some
                MAKETURNs put a signature here.
+324 204 BYTEs  Signature from FIZZ.BIN (offset 136, the 2 strings + sum)
+528 11 DWORDs  Id block (see below)

  Checksum `X' is computed the same way as in DOS TRNs: up to (but not
  including) the DOS structure. The first 316 bytes are part of this
  checksum!

  The Strings 1 and 2 give the exactly the same text as in FIZZ.BIN. Here,
  they are encoded as

    Character[i] := ( PartA[i] XOR PartB[i] )

  String 1 is interpreted as a serial number, 2 as registration date.
  The strings 3 and 4 appear "as is" in REG.LOG, they are unencoded. They
  are the name and address the user entered when unlocking his Winplan
  copy.

  Both DWORDs at position 8 and 12 give a value `Y':

    Y = ( VPHValue_A XOR VPHValue_B ) AND 7FFFFFFFh

  This equals the record `VPH_Record(Turn_Number)' from VPH35.DLL, see
  there. The values actually written to the TRN file come from
  SCRAM21.OLE, a file with the same information encoded in a different
  way.

  While THost also accepts unregistered TRNs with Windows trailer, and
  answers with Windows RSTs, PHost evaluates the Windows trailer only
  for registered clients: there is no unregistered Wisseman client which
  generates Windows TRNs. However, PCC can do this.


## Id Block

  The Identification block at the end of a TRN file allows a player to play
  several races with one registered client program. If 2 TRN files were
  generated by the same program, they contain the same registration
  signature and the same Id Block.

  With MAKETURN.EXE, the Id block contains 11 DWORDs. Each of these 11
  entries is the checksum `X' from the respective player's TRN file, or
  zero if that player was not processed by this MAKETURN invocation. For
  some unknown reason, player 11's position when he does not play is 0F31h.

  Winplan puts the respective game's SNOOKER.DAT entry here.

  The actual values put here do not really matter. All you must make sure
  that TRNs made for the same game from the same computer bear the same
  11-DWORD block. With current hosts, there is no requirement for the Id
  block to be derived from the TRN file contents in any way, like DOS
  MAKETURN generates it. The really only requirement is that TRN files
  from the same registered copy bear the same block. Older PHosts
  (3.15.1.x) required the DOS-Planets behaviour (entry N = player N's
  checksum `X'), and thus could not be used with Winplan.


Valid Commands
---------------

  For WORDs, possible values are generally 0..10'000, for DWORDs the range
  is 0..1'000'000'000. Other values (IDs, speeds) are more restricted.
  These ranges are the reason that ships may not carry more than 10000 mc,
  and that the parameters for 3rd-party missions (Intercept ID, Tow ID)
  must be between 0 and 500 (Ids!). See also the descriptions of the
  appropriate DAT files.

  PHost ignores the command pointers and assumes that the commands are
  stored directly after the pointers, with no padding inbetween. Versions
  up to 3.4b also will not necessarily do the Right Thing(tm) if commands
  are not in their canonical order (i.e. first ship commands, then planet,
  then base, then rest; each block sorted by Id; each object sorted by
  command code). Most known MAKETURNs fulfill these conditions though
  THost does not require them.

--- Code 1 (01h=ShipChangeFc) ---
 +0     WORD    Ship ID
 +2   3 BYTEs   New Friendly code

  Note that THost allows you to send multiple `ShipChangeFc' commands to
  trigger multiple alliance actions (eeX, ffX). This needs a specially
  prepared MAKETURN, however.

--- Code 2 (02h=ShipChangeSpeed) ---
 +0     WORD    Ship ID

 +8     WORD    Molybdenum
+10     WORD    Colonists
+12     WORD    Supplies
+14     WORD    Target ship ID

  Note that, when transferring to an own ship, PLANETS.EXE generates
  "dull" transfers (all amounts except for the target Id are zero),
  those should not be written to TRN files to avoid confusing the host
  (PHost up to 3.4i/4.0f only sees a intra-race transfer which is not
  permitted using this command).

  Note that the `PlanetBuildBase' command has no data. It is sent if the

  THost, you can include the data word; however, PHost does not accept
  such turns (see above).

  A well-known Winplan bug (now fixed) is that its built-in MAKETURN
  did not generate this command if the build order _changed_; instead it
  generated it if it was _present_. This prevented users from canceling
  a build order after the ship limit.

  PHost has a workaround for this, which you should be aware of when
  generating Winplan TRNs: if it receives a Winplan TRN, the BaseBuildShip
  command specifies the current build order for the starbase. If there is
  no such command for a particular starbase, the base's build order is
  canceled. So you must send this command for all bases with either
  changed or present build orders to generate TRNs suitable for both THost
  and PHost.

--- Code 54 (36h=BaseUpgradeTorpTech) ---
 +0     WORD    Base ID
 +2     WORD    New Tech Level

  The codes 55 (37h) to 59 (3Bh) are unused.

--- Code 60 (3Ch=SendMessage) ---
 +0     WORD    Length of message. The maximum length in THost is 700
                bytes, PHost formats the message to 40 columns and then
                allows 18 lines to be transmitted.
 +2     WORD    Sender (=Player ID)
 +4     WORD    Receiver
 +6   n BYTEs   Message (encrypted): Each byte is increased by 13dec.
                While DOS programs only encode a single byte for a line
                feed (0Dh, encrypted as 1Ah), Windows MAKETURN uses 0Dh
                0Ah (encrypted 1Ah 17h). See also MDATAx.DAT /
                MDATA35x.DAT. You should prefer using a single 0Dh only:
                a line in a message must not be longer than 40 characters,
                and THost counts the 0Ah as text character.

--- Code 61 (3Dh=ChangePassword) ---
 +0     WORD    0 (?)
 +2  10 BYTEs   New password, encrypted. Each character is increased by 32h

--- Code 62 (3Eh=SendBack) [PHost 4.0+] ---
 +0     WORD    Receiver race, 0 means same as sender. Currently must be
                either 0 or same as sender to avoid spoofing.
 +2     WORD    Record Type
 +4     WORD    Data Size. Note that the complete TRN command must be
                below 32k, hence this value must be < 32760. You'd better
                set the limit a bit lower to not tempt fate :)
 +6   n BYTEs   Data

  This command is ONLY supported by PHost 4.0 and later. The enclosed data
  will be echoed back to the player in his UTILx.DAT, as a normal UTILx.DAT
  record. This way, programs can send arbitrary information through the
  host. In particular, by sending file transfer records (type 34), one can
  send files.


Attachments
------------

  It is possible to embed files in a TRN file. These are then copied into
  the host directory when Host reads the TRN. This is used by TacCom
  to transmit alliance information. This method is only supported by the
  Wisseman host, not PHost or others. As a consequence, only few hosting
  utilities consider TRNs with attachment valid. This function is supported
  by Host 3.20 and later.

 +0  10 BYTEs   Signature "NCC1701AD9"
+10     DWORD   Location of original TRN data in this file (as usual, + 1)
+14     DWORD   Size of original TRN file in bytes
+18  10 RECORDs of 20 bytes each:
                 +0     DWORD   Position of embedded file ( + 1)
                 +4     DWORD   Length of embedded file
                 +8  12 BYTEs   File name, padded with spaces. Blank (=only
                                spaces) if this "slot" doesn't contain a
                                file.

  Following are the "attachments" and the TRN file. The host uses the data
  at +10 and +14 to extract the original TRN file. The result of extraction
  must be a valid TRN file (no more attachments).

  Host rejects BAT, DAT, EXT, HST, INI, LOG, NM, RST and TRN files; since
  3.22.035 also EXE, COM and BIN. This still is a security hole because
  it is still possible to upload files that end up as `.exe' on the Host's
  disk (I have a proof-of-concept program if you insist...)

  On the other hand, this is a method to work around the X Modem problem,
  because it explicitly encodes the TRN file size within the file. How
  many people still use X Modem is another question.


RST FILE
=========

 +0   8 DWORDs  Addresses of the file sections, each + 1
--- Host 3.20+ ---
+32   6 BYTEs   Signature "VER3.5" for Winplan RSTs.
+38   2 BYTEs   Sub-Version, currently either "00" or "01".
+40     DWORD   File position of the Winplan data, when existent.
+44     DWORD   Position of LEECHx.DAT, if existing (0 otherwise).
--- RST version "01" ---
+48     DWORD   Position of extended UFO database

  Normally, the data follows at 96 (60h) or 33 (21h), with some
  uninitialized data between the header and the data.

  Winplan RSTs are sent if the host didn't get a TRN file, or if it got a
  Windows Turn file. Winplan RSTs contain a "DOS part" built up exactly
  as the normal DOS file. Windows RSTs contain additional information, see
  below. PHost remembers the RST file style over turns, and only sends
  Windows RSTs to registered clients.

  To make your program robust, you should check all file pointers before
  using them. Everything but the first 8 sections was hacked into the
  RST format later, and earlier hosts do not blank out those fields.
  THost-generated RSTs sometimes (rarely) bear the "VER3.5" signature
  without actually being Windows-style files. This is because THost does
  not initialize the space after the header, and if DOS happens to assign
  a cluster previously used by a Windows-style file, the signature will be
  still there. To guard against this case, double-check the validity of
  the Winplan part of the file: the "1120" and "1211" signatures look like
  good candidates. If you found the "VER3.5" signature, the Winplan header
  itself usually is valid, as it comes from a real RST file: checking the
  file pointers alone for plausible values (i.e., "non-negative", "not
  more than 2 MB", ...) does not buy you much in this case.


Sections
---------

  The 8 standard file sections have the following contents:

--- Section 1 (pointer at +0): Ships ---
 +0     WORD    Number of ships
 +2   n BYTEs   Ship records of 107 bytes each, see SHIPx.DAT

--- Section 2 (pointer at +4): Visual Contacts ---
 +0     WORD    Number of contacts. Must be <= 50 for Wisseman clients.
                VPHost and PHost with AllowBigTargets allow more than 50
                contacts if the client-side unpacker can handle those
                (VPUnpack, k-unpack, CCUnpack).
 +2   n BYTEs   Records of 34 bytes each, see TARGETx.DAT.
                DOS-style RSTs: the 50 nearest contacts.
                Windows-style RSTs: the first 50 contacts (in Id order)

                The messages usually follow the message headers, and are
                encrypted like in MDATAx.DAT.
                Reportedly, Winplan cannot unpack results where the number
                of messages exceeds 5461, i.e., where the message directory
                is larger than 32k.

--- Section 6 (pointer at +20): Ship Coordinates ---

                 +4     WORD    Owner
                 +6     WORD    Mass in kt

--- Section 7 (pointer at +24): GENx.DAT ---
 +0  18 BYTEs   Timestamp
+18  88 BYTEs   11 score records of 8 bytes each
+106    WORD    Player Id
+108 20 BYTEs   Password
+128  3 DWORDs  Checksums of ship, planet, and base block
                These checksums are the sum of all unsigned bytes in all
                ship/planet/base records in the RST file. The first word
                of each section ("Number of...") is not counted. Note that
                these are not exactly the same checksums as in GENx.DAT.
+140    WORD    Turn number
+142    WORD    Timestamp checksum
                See GENx.DAT for more information on each field. Not all
                GENx.DAT fields are stored here, set the others to zero.

--- Section 8 (pointer at +28): VCRs ---
 +0     WORD    Number of VCRs
 +2   n BYTEs   VCR records of 100 bytes each, see VCRx.DAT.

  Unpack programs must generate two (nearly) identical copies of the ship,
  planet and base sections (.DAT and .DIS). Those files only differ in
  their signatures. The RST file does not contain the signatures.


## Detecting Host999

  There appears to be no signature telling whether you are dealing with
  a Host999 file or not. This only makes a difference for the SHIPXYx.DAT
  part which has no length specification. If section 1 or 2 contain an Id
  number greater than 500, you can be sure to have a Host999 RST (not for
  the scores or VCRs, those could have been changed by a 3rd party add on,
  since they have no other effect in a front-end program). You can use the
  fact that the Wisseman Host always places the sections in "correct"
  order, so if there are exactly 4000 bytes between sections 6 and 7, it's
  a "Host500" RST, if there are 7992, it's from Host999. Or, always assume
  you have 999 ships. If you then accidentally "run into" the GENx.DAT
  image: valid timestamps start with two numbers, which -- interpreted as
  a WORD -- yield an invalid or at least improbable X coordinate for a
  ship.

  Note that the standard Winplan999 and Unpack999 programs do not attempt
  to detect that, and blindly copy 7992 bytes, thus making bogus
  SHIPXYx.DAT files (see there) if Host999 is not used.

                                swept. All other information remains in
                                this minefield slot until the slot is

                                Note that this does not allow transmission
                                of web minefields that do not belong to the
                                Crystals. PHost sends non-Crystalline webs
                                as normal mines (1..11).

                 +0     WORD    ID Number

                Note that, except for the ship name, this is exactly a
                TARGETx.DAT record.


## LEECHx.DAT

  If the value at +44 is non-zero, it points to the following data:

 +0     DWORD   Size of LEECHx.DAT
 +4   n BYTEs   Contents of LEECHx.DAT

  You only need to place a file named LEECHx.DAT in the Host directory,
  and the Host will send it to the players. Winplan's UNPACK will unpack
  it to the game directory. This file is not used otherwise.


## Extended UFO database

  In version "01" RSTs, the value at +48 points to the following data:

 +0     WORD    Total number of UFOs. The minimum value is 100, as there
                are already 100 UFO records in the standard Winplan
                section.
 +2   n RECORDs of 78 bytes each: the UFOs. This field contains the UFOs
                from Id 101 onwards. Thus, the extended UFO database stores
                100 UFOs less than specified in the WORD above.


HOST DATA
==========

  These host data file formats are used by THost and PHost 3. PHost 2
  for non-DOS platforms uses a "native" format which is basically the
  same, but words are stored in the native byte order, and padding is used
  where required by the architecture/ABI.


AUXDATA.HST - PHost - Miscellaneous [V]
----------------------------------------

  Most of this description by Piotr Winiarczyk, with information from
  Heiko Schlenker, and then updated from PHost source. The 3.0/4.0
  definition is "official", whatever that means, hence the [V].

  Many arrays contain an unused zeroth element. PHost uses this to
  simplify index computations and checks. Bits not described here
  are zero.

  The file format is version dependent.


### All Versions

  The AUXDATA.HST file always starts with the version number of PHost.

 +0     BYTE    PHost major version
 +1     BYTE    PHost minor version


### PHost 4.x

 +0     BYTE    PHost major version (4)
 +1     BYTE    PHost minor version
 +2  18 BYTEs   Timestamp
+20     WORD    Turn number
+22     WORD    First-Battle Info. For each race, one bit which is set if
                the race has not yet seen a VCR and should be sent the
                introductory message.
+24  14 BYTEs   unused
+38   n BYTEs   data. A sequence of blocks of variable size:
                 +0     WORD    Block type
                 +2     WORD    Block size
                 +4   n BYTEs   Data
                Programs must preserve blocks they don't know, and should
                preserve the order of blocks. Blocks with numbers below
                100 have permanent information, numbers above 100 are
                transient and only exist during a host run.

--- Block 1 (Native races for starbases) ---
  A BYTE array, indexed by planet Id, 0 to 500 (i.e. first element is
  unused). Whenever a starbase is built, PHost saves the native race here.
  Thus, when unregistered Cyborgs build a base on a Ghipsoldal planet,
  they'll legally keep the T10 engines even when the natives are
  assimilated up and a new race appears.

  Usually, this record is 501 bytes, but may be larger or shorter for
  cross-version compatibility.

--- Block 2 (Alliances) ---
  An array of 169 WORDs, 13 rows of 13 WORDs each. Addressed as
  `ARRAY[0..12, 0..12] OF WORD', where the first index (rows) is the race
  offering an alliance, and the second index (columns) is the race the
  alliance is offered to. The borders (0, 12) are there to avoid index
  checks for unowned or Alien objects and are constant zero.
         Bit 0          Ship level offered
         Bit 1          Planet level offered
         Bit 2          Mine level offered
         Bit 3          Combat level offered
         Bit 4          Vision level offered
         Bit 5          Alliance offered
         Bits 8..12     Corresponding offers are conditional
  (compare to record type 22 in UTILx.DAT)

  This must be exactly 338 bytes.

--- Block 3 (Ship Scan Info) ---
  A WORD array, indexed by ship Id, starting with 0 (i.e. first element is
  unused). For each ship, this contains a bitfield of the races (other than
  the owner of the ship) who saw the ship. This is used for consistency
  checking of Intercept missions.
         Bit 1          Fed saw it
         Bit 2          Lizard saw it
  etc.

  Size may vary depending on the ship limit.

--- Block 4 (Build Queue) ---
  This block consists of a number of records of the following format:
         +0     WORD    Starbase Id
         +2     WORD    Hull type
         +4     WORD    Engine type
         +6     WORD    Beam type
         +8     WORD    Beam count
        +10     WORD    Torpedo type
        +12     WORD    Torpedo launcher count
        +14     WORD    1 if cloning, 0 for regular build
        +16     WORD    Race
        +18     DWORD   Points in queue (priority)
        +22     DWORD   unused

  This block's size may vary depending on the build queue length.

--- Block 5 (PAL) ---
  This block contains an array of DWORDs containing the current PAL for
  each player. It is indexed by 0 (first element unused), and usually
  contains a 13th element (index 12) which isn't used either.

--- Block 6 (Remote Control) ---
  This block contains two WORD arrays of equal size.

  The first array contains records of the following format:
         +0     BYTE    controller of an RC'd ship
         +1     BYTE    80h if remote control forbidden, 0 else
  As usual, the 0th entry is unused.

  The second array contains the real owners of remote-controlled ships,
  0 if ship is not under RC. The 0th entry contains a bitmask of the
  player's "remote default" status:
         Bit 1  Player 1 did "remote forbid default"
         Bit 2  Player 2 did "remote forbid default"
  etc.

  The size of this block may vary, which affects the size of both arrays.

--- Block 7 (Ship Specials) ---
  This record contains hull functions assigned to individual ships. For
  each ship, it contains 8 bytes (64 bits):
         +0     BYTE    Special abilities 0 .. 7
         +1     BYTE    Special abilities 8 .. 15
         +2     BYTE    Special abilities 16 .. 23
  etc. There is no unused dummy element.

  The size of this block may vary.

--- Block 8 (reserved) ---

--- Block 9 (Ship Experience) ---
--- Block 10 (Planet Experience) ---
  These records contain, for each ship/planet, one DWORD with the number
  of experience points it has. They do not contain an unused dummy element.

  The size of this block may vary depending on the number of ships.

--- Block 11 (Permanent Enemies) [PHost 4.0h+] ---
  This record contains 11 WORDs, one per player. Bits in each word
  mark the players who are declared permanent enemies using 'enemies
  add', i.e. if player 3 does 'enemies add 6', bit 6 (valued 64) will
  be set in the third word.

  There is no unused dummy element.

--- Block 12 (Modified Ship Specials) [PHost 4.0i+] ---
  This record has the same format as block 7. It contains 64 bits per
  ship. The actual meaning of the bits is defined in block 13.

--- Block 13 (Modified Ship Special Definitions) [PHost 4.0i+] ---
  This block contains 64 entries of the following format:
         +0      WORD    Basic device number (see HULLFUNC.DAT)
         +2      WORD    Experience level mask (bit 0 = L0 etc.)
  Unused entries are zero.

--- Block 101 (Ship Flags) [PHost 4.0d+] ---
  This block contains, for each ship, one DWORD with some useful
  flags. There is no dummy element. The size of this block may vary
  depending on the number of ships.

   Bit 0         Ship was re-crewed (captured) this turn
   Bits 1 .. 31  unused

--- Block 102 (Planet Flags) [PHost 4.0d+] ---
  This block contains, for each ship, one DWORD with some useful
  flags. There is no dummy element. The size of this block may vary
  depending on the number of ships.

   Bit 0         Planet was re-crewed this turn (can this happen?)
   Bits 1 .. 31  unused

--- Block 103 (New Ship Experience) [PHost 4.0d+] ---
--- Block 104 (New Planet Experience) [PHost 4.0d+] ---
  These blocks contain, for each ship/planet, the number of new
  experience points gathered this turn, one DWORD per unit. Points
  will be collected and added to the real experience at the end of the
  host run.

  There is no dummy element.

--- Block 105 (Turn Activity Level) [PHost 4.0f+] ---
  This block contains 11 DWORDs with the turn activity level for each
  player. The TAL is added to the player activity level at the end of
  each turn.

--- Block 106 (Inhibited ship functions) [PHost 4.0i+] ---
  This record contains the ship functions inhibited by the host or by
  add-ons this turn. It has the same format as record 7 (64 bits per
  ship).

--- Block 107 (Explosions) [PHost 4.0k+] ---
  This block contains 50 records of 4 bytes:
         +0      WORD    X
         +2      WORD    Y
  (this is the same format as the Explosions field in KOREx.DAT)

  Blank slots have both X and Y equal to zero. The block starts with
  all used slots, followed by an appropriate amount of blank slots (if
  a blank slot sits between used slots, PHost will "compact" the data,
  and thus modify explosion numbers).


### PHost 3.x or 2.x

  The contents of a 2.x/3.x file is similar to the contents of a 4.x file,
  but does not contain the descriptive block headers.

 +0     BYTE    PHost major version

### PHost 1.x [T]

 +0     BYTE    PHost major version
 +1     BYTE    PHost minor version
 +2 501 BYTEs   Native races for starbases
 +? 144 BYTEs   Alliance info. An `ARRAY[0..11, 0..11] OF BYTE', where
                where the first index (rows) is the race offering an
                alliance, and the second index (columns) is the race the
                alliance is offered to. Index 0 is not used.
                 Bit 0          Ship level offered
                 Bit 1          Planet level offered

                +10     WORD    Torpedo type
                +12     WORD    Torpedo launcher count


BDATA.HST - Starbase Data [V]
------------------------------

  This is nearly the same format as BDATAx.DAT:

 +0     WORD    ? (unused?)
 +2   n BYTEs   500 starbase records of 156 bytes each, see BDATAx.DAT.
+78000  WORD    Turn number. If this number does not match the number in
                NEXTTURN.HST, THost prints an error message and uses
                the number from BDATAx.HST.


BUFF.TMP - Temporary File
BUFFPNT.TMP - Temporary File
-----------------------------

  In THost games, these files contain all anonymous messages. BUFF.TMP
  contains the texts, BUFFPNT.TMP contains addressee and file pointers.
  See MESS.EXT/MESSPNT.EXT below.

  The addressee of each message is set to zero when the message is
  delivered.

  THost never deletes these files, so they can grow large over time. You
  can safely delete them after a Host run.


CLOAKC.HST - Cloak & Shield State [V]
--------------------------------------

  [Host 3.22.017+, PHost 3] If AUXBC.INI is used, host creates this file
  before running AUXBC.INI and reads it back later (at least the cloak
  flags).

  For the "normal" host and PHost 3.x, this file contains 2x500 words.
  For Host999 and PHost 4.x, it contains 2x999.

 +0   N WORDs   1, if the corresponding ship is cloaked.
+2N   N WORDs   Shield Charge States (0..100). Non-existing ships have
                value 100 here. Don't confuse this with the Shield
                Strength measured in kt, host does not store this value
                as you can compute it manually:
                   (hull mass) + (ES bonus)*(engine price)/100


ETEMPx.TMP - Temporary File
----------------------------

  This file is created while making the TARGETx.DAT records for the RST
  files. It contains the targets not fitting into the DOS part of the
  RST file. You can delete this file after the host run, the host does
  not always do this itself.

 +0     DWORD   Number of records
 +4   n BYTEs   Records of 34 bytes each. See RST file description or
                the KOREx.DAT file format for more information.


EXTMINES.HST - PHost - Minefields
----------------------------------

  This file contains 9500 minefield records for minefields #501 to #10000.
  It is used by PHost 3.3 and later when the appropriate config option
  is set. The file format is the same as MINES.HST.


GEN.HST - Passwords and other
------------------------------

 +0  46 BYTEs   ?
+46  11 WORDs   1, if the race is playing, 0 otherwise
+68 220 BYTEs   Passwords. To get the password for player X:
                  VAR pw : ARRAY[1..22, 1..10] OF BYTE;  { this field }
                      password : ARRAY[1..10] OF CHAR;
                  FOR i:=1 TO 10 DO
                   password[i] := Chr( pw[X,i] - pw[X+11,11-i] + 32 )
                This is similar to GENx.DAT. The resulting password is
                zero-padded, not space-padded. High-ASCII characters
                should be treated as zero, because MASTER sometimes
                generates those.
+288  n BYTEs   ?
+448    WORD    Ship build queue: Id of starbase that built the last
                "normal" ship (not a priority build).

  Fields marked with "?" are probably unused. They contain random stuff
  from deleted files.


GREY.HST - Miscellaneous
-------------------------

 +0 500 WORDs   Experience values of starship crews
+1000 n BYTEs   Ion storms: 50 records of 16 bytes each
                 +0     WORD    X
                 +2     WORD    Y
                                Note that Host sometimes (rarely) generates
                                storms with negative coordinates.
                 +4     WORD    Radius

                                   >=200        Class 5 (very dangerous)
                                Only class 4/5 storms hurt ships.

                +12   2 WORDs   ? (unused?)
+1800 11 WORDs  Build Priority Points
--- Host 3.22.007 and later ---
+1822 11 WORDs  Alliances. This field contains information on who a player
                has declared an ally:
                 Bit 0  1=the player set the Feds as his ally
                 Bit 1  1=the player set the Lizards as his ally
                 ...
                 Bit 10 1=the player set the Colonies as his ally
                Ships of the player won't attack ships of his allies.
--- Host 3.22.027 and later ---
+1844  3 BYTEs  unused (?)
+1847 500 WORDs Cheat check flags, for all planets/bases.
                 Bit 0  1=starbase with this Id has built a ship. Used
                        to prevent multiple clones at one base.
                 Bit 1  1=ship with this Id has moved (itself or by being
                        towed) and is denied chunneling. Used to prevent
                        "tow-drop chunnels". Note that this flag is also
                        set for tow pairs when the tower does not move.
                There is no Host999 3.22.027 (yet?); it is unknown how it
                would handle this array.
--- Host 3.22.039 and later ---
+2847 11 WORDs  Level 2 Alliances ("FF allies"). For each player, whom he
                has declared a level 2 ally, as a bitfield like above.
                If a bit is set here, the corresponding bit at +1822 is
                set, too.


## Ion Storms

  An active storm is identified by a non-zero voltage. Storms that have
  disappeared are still stored but have voltage 0. There may only be as
  many ion storms as specified in the HConfig file (default: 5), so that
  normally not all fields could contain real storms.

  When a new game is started, there are always some active Ion storms. It
  may happen that a player gets a message about a storm with 0 MeV. Due to
  the encoding here, that storm won't appear on the starcharts.

  Storm speeds are not stored here, they are computed when they're needed.
  As of Host 3.22.003, the Ion storm speeds were these:
  * Storms with more than 250 MeV always move at warp 8
  * Storms smaller than 200 ly move at warp 6.
  * Larger storms move at
    Warp 2   (20%)
    Warp 3   (48%)
    Warp 4   (32%)
  Use first matching rule. Older Hosts only use the last two rules.

  Ion storms that move outside 0 <= X <= 4000 resp. 0 <= Y <= 4000 are
  deleted the turn _after_ they moved there. Thus, it is possible that
  a storm with negative coordinates is reported.

  New storms are not subject to the usual rules. They can also have other
  speeds (Warp 5, Warp 7).


## PHost

  When PHost is being used, this file is only a dummy version. PHost
  creates it, but sets all fields to zero. Only the alliance data is
  written: PHost sets a particular alliance bit to one if and only if
  the player has offered all five PHost alliance levels to his ally.
  This file is never read by PHost, changing it won't influence the host.
  Use AUXDATA.HST to affect PHost.

  PHost 4.0j and later also uses the Ion Storm field, using the same
  meaning as THost.


HCONFIG.HST - Configuration [V]
--------------------------------

  Fields marked with "-" contain boolean values: 1=yes, 0=no. Probabilities
  are given in percent in most cases.

 +0     WORD    Recycle Rate for "Colonize" mission, %
 +2     WORD    Odds of a meteor

+108 12 WORDs   Tax rates for each player (50..500%)
                These fields contain 12 words. The first word in each range
                is 0, the remaining 11 entries contain the data.

  New Hosts normally append their new settings after the end of the file.
  Note that Host itself will not upgrade the HConfig file, if the file
  has the wrong size, the default configuration is used. The HCONFIG.EXE
  program must be used to enlarge the file.

  Some add-ons (most notably, the D&D ones) also read HCONFIG.HST, and
  cease to work if it does not exist.


LASTTURN.HST - Timestamp
-------------------------

 +0  18 BYTEs   Timestamp of last host run
+18     WORD    0

  This file is updated after writing the RSTs. Programs run as AUXHOST
  use the old value.

  In PHost 3.x and before, this file contains the same timestamp as
  NEXTTURN.HST (i.e. the timestamp of the current host run, not the
  previous one). Thus, add-ons run during PHost processing can not
  access the old timestamp.


MESS.OLD - Old Messages (=sent last turn)
MESS.EXT - External Messages (sent by Hostmaster)
MESS.TMP - Current Message Traffic
--------------------------------------------------

  These files contain - encrypted the usual way, see MDATAx.DAT - some
  message texts. The corresponding MESSPNT files contain pointers into
  these files.

  The MESS.EXT file contains messages sent by the host using the SENDMESS
  program. The messages must be "complete", i.e., with all headers. Host
  itself only prepends the "(-h000)" signature, so the MESS.EXT file must
  supply the "<<< Subspace Message >>>", "FROM: Host" and "TO: player"
  headers. Host renames it to MESS.TMP when starting.

  The MESS.OLD file contains all messages from the last host run, to allow
  delivering them after a missed turn. If this feature is enabled
  (HCONFIG.HST, offset +8), up to 100 old messages are saved. Before
  exiting, Host renames MESS.TMP to MESS.OLD, so this file stores all
  messages generated by the host, sent by players, and external messages.

  The MESS.TMP file only exists during a host run, available to AUXHOST1
  and AUXHOST2 programs.

  See also BUFF.TMP.


MESSPNT.OLD - Pointers to Old messages
MESSPNT.EXT - Pointers to External messages
MESSPNT.TMP - Pointers to Current messages
--------------------------------------------

 +0     WORD    Number of messages in the file
 +2   n BYTEs   Records of 8 bytes each
                 +0     WORD    Receiver race
                 +2     DWORD   Address in MESS.OLD/.EXT/.TMP file, 1-based
                 +6     WORD    Length of message

  See MESS.OLD/.EXT/.TMP for more information about usage of these files.
  See also BUFFPNT.TMP.


MINES.HST - Mine fields
------------------------

500 records of 12 bytes each
 +0     WORD    X
 +2     WORD    Y
 +4     WORD    Owner
 +6     DWORD   Number of Mine Units. The radius of each mine field is the
                square root of this value.
                The maximum value here is 3000²=9,000,000 (3000 is the
                maximum possible mine field radius that can be set in
                HCONFIG), resp. 25,000,000 (maximum set by the Host
                program).
+10     WORD    Type
                 0      Normal Mines
                 1      Web Mines

  Unused minefields are identified by the radius and owner being zero.
  Non-Crystalline Web Mines are problematic. They can't be transmitted
  to Winplan (see KOREx.DAT), and Host does sometimes still assume that
  Web Mines always belong to the Crystals.

  Minefields with Id greater than 500 are stored in EXTMINES.HST (PHost).


NEXTTURN.HST - Timestamp
-------------------------

 +0  18 BYTEs   Timestamp of last host run
+18     WORD    Current Turn number

  This file is updated before reading in the TRNs. Programs run as AUXHOST
  use the new turn number.


OLDFIG.HST - Host Configuration
--------------------------------

  This file is basically the same as HCONFIG.HST. It contains the
  configuration of the last host run. If this file differs from
  HCONFIG.HST, the new HConfig is sent to the players as message.


PDATA.HST - Planet data
------------------------

 +0     WORD    ? (unused)
 +2   n BYTEs   500 planet records of 85 bytes each, see PDATAx.DAT.

  FHost is reported to mark destroyed planets by setting their ore content,
  temperature, etc. to unpleasant values (everything zero). Note that the
  "correct" way of destroying planets is to move them out of the way using
  XYPLAN.DAT, not by zeroing them out in this file: the change in
  XYPLAN.DAT can be communicated to the players, the change in PDATA.HST
  can not.

  PHost considers planets non-existent when it has an Id of zero in
  this file (normally, planet slot X has Id X). Recent versions report
  that fact using a UTILx.DAT entry; in earlier versions, this is
  problematic, too, because it can't be communicated to the players.


PHONEY.HST - Hull Remapping Hook
---------------------------------

  This file contains 500 WORDs, one per ship. If a ship's entry is a valid
  hull number (1..105), that number is reported as ship type through visual
  scans (TARGETx.DAT). If a value is outside this range (e.g. zero), or if
  this file does not exist, the normal hull type is reported.

  This file is used by the RacePlus Chameleon device.


REFDATA.HST - Victory Conditions [T]
-------------------------------------

  This file is created by MASTER, but not used by the host. The external
  REF program uses this file, RCONFIG can edit it.

 +0     WORD    1 if a scenario was chosen in RCONFIG, 0 otherwise
 +2     WORD    Scenario chosen in MASTER (starting conditions)
                 1      Classic (Homeworlds in a circle)
                 2      Custom (Homeworlds at selected positions)
                 3      Wandering Tribes (all at the same spot)
                 4      Wandering Tribes (all at selected positions)
                 5      Wandering Tribes ("mass confusion")
                 6      Ashes of the Empire
                 7      Crazy Intermix (no borders)
                 8      Disunited Kingdoms (all with a number of planets)
                Master 3.00 can do scenarios 1 to 3 only.
 +4     WORD    ? (0)
 +6  11 WORDs   ID numbers of homeworlds, 0=none ("Wandering Tribes"
                scenario, or race is not playing) Set by MASTER.
+28     WORD    ? (0)
--- "Tantalus" ---
+30  11 WORDs   Number of turns the race already controlled the Tantalus
                machine.
+52     WORD    ID of planet with Tantalus machine
+54     WORD    Number of turns a player needs to control the Tantalus
                machine in order to set it off
--- "Ashes of the Empire" ---
+56     WORD    Race playing the empire
--- general ---
+58     WORD    Scenery chosen in RCONFIG (victory condition)
                 1      Elections
                 2      Ship Tonnage
                 3      Election + Ship Tonnage
                 4      Tantalus Machine
                 5      Moly The Spice of Life (Molybdenum)
                 6      Ashes of the Empire
                 7      Invasion (capture homeworlds)
+60     DWORD   ? (0)
+64  11 DWORDs  Current REF scores
+156    DWORD   Score required to win (except "Ashes..." and "Tantalus")
+160    DWORD   ? (0)
+164    WORD    Winning race, 0 = no one yet

  The fields marked ? are probably remainders of BASIC arrays: a
  `DIM a(11)' statement defines an array with 12 members (0..11).

  Fields for scenarios other than the chosen one are zero.


SHIP.HST - Ship Data
---------------------

 +0     WORD    ? (unused)
 +2   n BYTEs   500 (resp. 999) ship records of 107 bytes each, see
                SHIPx.DAT.


SHIPSCAN.EXT - PHost - Ship Scan Information [V]
-------------------------------------------------

  This file describes who currently sees which ship. It is a text file.

  First line: identification
  - "0": this is the first turn;
  - "99 02-22-200022:33:44": this is turn 99, and the timestamp is "02...".
  Use this line to verify this file is current.

  500 (resp. 999) lines: two numbers separated by a space, for each ship.
  - The first number specifies what "enemies" see this ship, i.e.
    everybody but the owner and his allies who scanned the ship;
  - The second number specifies what "allies" see this ship, i.e.,
    the ship owner, and his ship level allies.
  Each number should be treated as a bitfield. Bit 1 is set if the Feds
  see the ship, bit 2 for the Lizards, etc. Bit 0 is zero. The two sets
  are disjoint. Use this to verify if a player triggering some action
  can actually see the target ship. A line contains two zeroes if the
  ship does not exist.

  This file is written for auxiliary programs; it is never read by PHost.
  PHost uses information stored in AUXDATA.HST.


SHIPXY.HST - Ship Coordinates
------------------------------

  Same as SHIPXYx.DAT. All ships are stored. Host uses this file instead
  of fetching the relevant data from the SHIP.HST file, hence add-ons must
  update both files. In particular, Host does not update it before doing
  Ion Storm effects, therefore it uses ship masses from the previous turn.

  PHost does not read this file and only writes it for compatibility.

500 (resp. 999) ship records:
 +0     WORD    X position
 +2     WORD    Y position
 +4     WORD    Owner
 +6     WORD    Mass in kt


TONS.HST - Ship tons "sunk" this turn [V]
------------------------------------------

  This file is created by the host, but never used again. The TONS.EXE
  program can make a text file from this file. This can be used for
  scoring purposes.

 +0  11 DWORDs  Sum of sunk ships (total masses destroyed by player)
+44  11 DWORDs  Sunk tonnage this turn
--- PHost 3.4b+: HeikoTons[tm]: ---

+132 11 DWORDs  Lost tonnage this turn


TONS2.HST - Ship tech sunk this turn [T]
-----------------------------------------

  Like TONS.HST, this one counts ship tonnage sunk this turn. It has the
  very same format. However, this one scores ship mass times tech level,
  that is, when you destroy a 150 kt Tech 6 ship, you get 6x150=900
  points.

  This file is generated by THost only.


UFO.HST - UFOs, 3rd party additions [V]
----------------------------------------

  This file contains UFO data. These are not used within the host program,
  but sent to Winplan users in RST files. This file allows third-party
  programs to create completely new objects. Players can interact with
  these UFOs using the mission codes 20...999, special FCodes or messages,
  depending upon the program.

  The host uses the visibility ranges to decide which UFO to send to which
  player. This makes it impossible to show a particular UFO to selected
  players only.

The file contains 100 or 1000 records of 78 bytes each:
 +0     WORD    Color (1..15)
                0 means this UFO doesn't exist. The color is the usual
                encoding for colors in VGA text and graphics modes:
                 0      black            8      dark gray
                 1      blue             9      light blue
                 2      green           10      light green

                other things than a Warp speed here...)

+72     WORD    Distance from which a ship can see the object

                5000.
+74     WORD    Radius of object
+76     WORD    Type of object. A program always should use only objects
                if it knows their type. To avoid collisions, each
                programmer should get a range of ID numbers from Tim
                Wisseman. These are already assigned:

## PHost Wormholes

  Wormholes are not stored in the UFO.HST file; only in RST files and
  KOREx.DAT. PHost "overlays" them during RST creation.

  Wormholes are mapped to UFOs and then filtered. PHost allocates one
  UFO slot for unidirectional wormholes, and two slots for bidirectional
  ones. From the sequence of UFOs alone you can not tell whether a
  particular wormhole is the entry or the exit of a bidirectional
  wormhole. Matters are complicated by the fact that wormholes are
  reported with a different Id in UTILx.DAT and as UFO.

  However, the sequence of Wormhole reports in UTILx.DAT and the sequence
  of wormhole UFOs can be matched against, so the UTILx.DAT sequence
  can deliver the real Ids for wormhole UFOs (UTILx.DAT does not contain
  the information whether a wormhole is unidirectional or bidirectional!).
  Thanks to Piotr Winiarczyk for this.

  Wormhole UFOs always have color 2. In PHost before 3.3e, they always
  have radius 5 and visibility range 5000; later versions report the
  correct values.


UTIL.TMP - PHost - Temporary UTILx.DAT Files [T]/[V]
-----------------------------------------------------

  When PHost is run in phases, or shells out to execute an add-on (AUXHOST,
  PControl), it saves the data that is going to be UTILx.DAT files in a
  file called UTIL.TMP. You can try to make use of this.

  The official reading is that add-ons that are just that -- add-ons --
  should write to UTILx.EXT; add-ons that replace stages in PCONTROL
  can write to UTIL.TMP (to make their records come out at the right
  place). Add-ons can read this file to gather information about what
  PHost told the players yet.

  Like UTILx.DAT, UTIL.TMP consists of multiple records.


### Portable Format [PHost 3.4 and later] [V]

Each record starts with a header of the following format:
 +0     WORD    Player Id (whose UTILx.DAT file will contain this data)
 +2     WORD    Record Type. See UTILx.DAT in the `Player Data' section
 +4     WORD    Record Length
 +6   n BYTEs   Data

  The data is in the format you'd expect, like in UTILx.DAT.


### Unportable Format [PHost 3.3e and before] [T]

  In these PHost versions, UTIL.TMP was just a temporary file. Hence it
  contains data in host byte order, with padding inserted by the compiler,
  which makes accessing it a quite fragile process. Your best bet is to
  declare a C struct, and hope it comes out the same way as it did in
  PHost.

  For PHost 3.2e for "PC/DOS" (Borland C), the format is the following:

Each record:
 +0     DWORD   Player Id (whose UTILx.DAT file will contain this data)
 +4     DWORD   Record Type. See UTILx.DAT in the `Player Data' section
 +8     WORD    Record Length
+10   n BYTEs   Data

--- Type 13 (Control record - File Header) ---
 +0  18 BYTEs   Timestamp
+18     WORD    Turn number
+20     WORD    Player number
+22     WORD    0 (not in UTILx.DAT)
+24   2 BYTEs   PHost Major versions
+26   8 DWORDs  Specification file digests
+58  32 BYTEs   Game Name
+90     BYTE    PHost Release Code
+91     BYTE    0 (not in UTILx.DAT)

  Under PHost 3.3e for x86/Linux (GNU C), the format is different (two
  padding bytes after the PHost version, two more at the end).


UTILx.EXT - PHost - Add-on Information [V]
-------------------------------------------

  See under UTILx.DAT. If an add-on program generates UTILx.EXT, PHost
  appends its contents to the UTILx.DAT file sent to the player.


VCR.HST - VCRs
---------------

This file contains all VCRs from a turn:
 +0     WORD    Number of VCRs
 +2   n RECORDs of 100 bytes each (VCRs, see VCRx.DAT)


XTERNCMD.EXT - PHost - External Commands
-----------------------------------------

  This is a text file. PHost places all commands sent through the Command
  Processor's `xtern' command here. Add-on programs may make use of this.

  The first line contains the turn number, followed by a space and the
  timestamp, so add-ons can check if the file is current. On the very
  first turn, this file contains just the single digit "0".

  Following lines contain the actual commands, in the form
  "player number: command", where "player number" is the number from 1 to
  11, and "command" is what followed the `xtern' command. As of PHost 3.4b,
  there are no limits of line length.

  You can use the `xtern' command as a replacement for comments in command
  messages. EchoView does this to mark auto-generated messages: these
  start with `xtern echoview TYPE'.

  It is recommended that add-ons recognize a command `cmd' also when
  spelled as `name: cmd', where `name' is the name of the add-on. This
  makes it clear whom a command belongs to.


XTRFCODE.TXT - PHost - Special Friendly Codes
----------------------------------------------

  This file can be generated by add-on programs to tell PHost what
  friendly codes to consider "special". Those will then never match during
  combat, etc.

  It must contain sequences of up to three non-whitespace characters,
  separated by any amount of whitespace. Whitespace can be at least the
  space character (ASCII 32), the tab (ASCII 9) and the newline (ASCII 10).
  If one definition is less than three characters long, it causes all
  friendly codes starting with that sequences to be considered special.

  E.g., if XTRFCODE.TXT contains "lfm md X", it will define "lfm" special,
  all codes starting with "md" (mine drop), and all starting with "X"
  (inhibit Super Spy Deluxe). Note that PHost itself does *not* consider
  "md" and "X" special because they should match.

  PHost 3.4 and later automatically include their own friendly codes in
  this file at host-side; earlier versions did not. When players request
  this file, their copy will always include the built-in special codes.


XYPLAN.DAT - Planet coordinates
XYPLAN.HST - Planet coordinates
--------------------------------

500 records of 6 bytes each:
 +0     WORD    X coordinate (1000..3000, 1000=left)
 +2     WORD    Y coordinate (1000..3000, 1000=bottom)
 +4     WORD    Owner. In the .DAT file which is also used by the Planets
                program, this field is 0. MASTER makes a copy with the
                name XYPLAN.HST.

  PLANETS.EXE checks if XYPLAN.DAT has changed by adding up all X
  coordinates. The result must be exactly 998681. Otherwise, it refuses
  to run with the message
   "ERROR: Data file XYPLAN.DAT has been tampered with.
           Program terminated to avoid a security breach."
  There is a patch available, since "custom universes" are quite popular.

  According to Roger Burton West there is also an Y checksum with the
  value 1002633, but I could not confirm this. My copies of PLANETS.EXE
  and Winplan had no problems with this.

  If you roll your own map, you have two alternatives for making the
  checksums right:
  - as long as your map checksum differs by more than 500 from the required
    value, move it to the left or right until it is in range. To correct
    the rest, move some single planets;
  - use less than 500 planets, and use some hidden ones to compensate the
    checksum (see below).
  Or, ignore all this and require your players to use 3rd-party front-ends.

  XYPLAN.HST is used (and updated) by the Wisseman host only. PHost only
  uses XYPLAN.DAT, and never modifies it. In contrast, the Wisseman host only
  uses XYPLAN.HST.


## Maps with less than 500 planets

  In Explore Map games, planets which were not yet scanned usually have
  "impossible" coordinates (e.g., zero, or 9000 and greater). Considering
  all planets with either or both coordinates outside the range 1..8999 as
  non-existent seems to work well. This is also used on "static" maps with
  less than 500 planets.

  An add-on providing Explore Map features or things like moving planets
  can use these hidden planets to adjust the coordinate checksums: if the
  Y coordinate is zero, the X coordinate can be anything that fits your
  needs (...and the checksum).

  If a wraparound map (Sphere/PWrap) is used, PHost considers all planets
  outside the wrap rectangle non-existent. On a non-wrapped map, these
  planets are not strictly non-existing. Players with sufficiently much
  time can still reach them and colonize them. Hence it makes sense to put
  them *far* away (Y=9000), and distributed well (i.e. not all at in the
  same sector).


FIXED DATA
===========

  These data files usually remain constant throughout a game: it's rather
  painful to change them in mid-game while avoiding Tim Continuum attacks.
  Both the host and the players must use exactly the same data set.

  Some of these files are some bytes longer than required. These bytes
  are not used and contain only parts of deleted files on Wisseman's
  hard disk.

  Tim's CONFIG.SYS was exactly 215 bytes large on 9/May/1992 at 9:03 pm.

  The ship specification files need to have fixed sizes checked for by
  PLANETS.EXE:
    BEAMSPEC.DAT        360 bytes
    ENGSPEC.DAT         598 bytes (4 bytes more than required)
    HULLSPEC.DAT        6300 bytes
    TORPSPEC.DAT        470 bytes (90 bytes more than required)
  PLANETS.EXE computes a checksum each time it is started to prevent using
  modified files. The sum of all bytes of these 4 files must be exactly
  338817. Otherwise Planets refuses to run with the message
   "ERROR: Main data files have been tampered with."
  However, the 94 superfluous bytes should be enough to compensate changes.

  TRUEHULL.DAT is 940 bytes by default, of which only 440 are needed.


BEAMSPEC.DAT - Beam weapons [V]
--------------------------------

For each weapon (10) a record of 36 bytes:
 +0  20 BYTEs   Name
+20     WORD    Cost (mc)
+22     WORD    Tritanium needed
+24     WORD    Duranium needed
+26     WORD    Molybdenum needed
+28     WORD    Mass
+30     WORD    Tech Level
+32     WORD    Kill value
+34     WORD    Damage value


ENGSPEC.DAT - Engines [V]
--------------------------

For each engine (9) a record of 66 bytes:
 +0  20 BYTEs   Name
+20     WORD    Cost (mc)
+22     WORD    Tritanium needed
+24     WORD    Duranium needed
+26     WORD    Molybdenum needed
+28     WORD    Tech Level
+30   9 DWORDs  Fuel used to travel 1 month at the given speed, for each
                warp factor, for a 100000 kt ship

  Fuel used to travel d light years with a ship of m kt at speed v:

        d * m * X(v)         d
    N = ------------    t = --- (approximated)
        v*v * 100000        v*v

  N is the fuel required, t the time required (E.T.A.) and X(v) is the
  value from the table above. When traveling longer than 1 month (t>1),
  the fuel usage is calculated again each month since the ship mass
  changes (less Neutronium aboard).

  See DISTTABL.DAT (under 3rd-party Clients) for how to correctly
  compute the d used in this formula.

  After the engine records, 4 unused bytes follow.


FRIDAY.DAT - SRACE - Race Assignments
--------------------------------------

  This file contains 11 WORDs with the new race / player assignments. The
  first WORD contains the race number of the first player etc.


HULLFUNC.DAT - PHost - Hull Functionalities [V]
------------------------------------------------

  PHost generates this file from HULLFUNC.TXT, for use by other programs.
  PHost itself never reads this file. Your program, should it want to
  support this mechanism, can either read this file or manually parse
  HULLFUNC.TXT. For example, for older PCC, the `hullgen' utility converts
  HULLFUNC.TXT into HULLSPEC.CC (PCC started earlier than PHost 3).

  PHost 4.0i and later allows to define hull functions restricted to
  particular experience levels. As of July 2005, those are not stored
  in HULLFUNC.DAT. In other files such as UTILx.DAT, they are referred
  to with numbers from the reserved range; see UTILx.DAT record 52 and
  57.


HULLSPEC.DAT - Starship Hulls [V]
----------------------------------

For each hull (105) a record of 60 bytes:

 +0  30 BYTEs   Name
+30     WORD    Number of picture in RESOURCE.PLN
                Some pictures are used more than once, but with a different
                palette (e.g., Super Transport Freighter + Merlin Class
                Alchemy Ship + Neutronic Refinery Ship). I don't know where
                this information comes from, it seems to be hard-coded in
                PLANETS.EXE. Winplan automatically uses different pictures
                for hull numbers 104 and 105 (see below).
+32     WORD    =1. In VPCPLAY.BAS this field is identified as "image of a
                heavily damaged ship", though it seems to be unused.
+34     WORD    Tritanium needed
+36     WORD    Duranium needed
+38     WORD    Molybdenum needed
+40     WORD    Fuel tank size
+42     WORD    Crew size
+44     WORD    Number of engines
+46     WORD    Hull mass (empty)
+48     WORD    Tech Level
+50     WORD    Cargo room
+52     WORD    Number of fighter bays
+54     WORD    max. Number of torpedo launchers
+56     WORD    max. Number of beam weapons
+58     WORD    Cost (mc)

  A "hull number" is the number of the record in this file, where the
  first record is hull number 1.

  Information whether a hull has a cloaking device is hard-coded in
  PLANETS.EXE / SHIPS.EXE / HOST.EXE. The following hulls always have a
  cloaking device:
    21 22 25 26 27 28 29 31 32 33 36 38 43 44 45 46 47.

  Information on Gravitonic Accelerators and other "bells and whistles"
  is also hard-coded and can't be changed in custom ship lists for THost.
  For PHost, see HULLFUNC.DAT and the PHost documentation about
  SHIPLIST.TXT / HULLFUNC.TXT.

  The number of possible starship hulls needs to be 105 or less, although
  the game concept would allow up to 220 different hulls (20 slots for
  each of the 11 players). The host simply refuses to build ships with a
  higher hull number, and the PHost PDK also hardwires the maximum hull
  ID to 105.

  Winplan automatically "corrects" this information (though not the disk
  file): hull 65 gets the name "TOPAZ CLASS GUNBOAT", hull 88 becomes a
  "GUARDIAN CLASS DESTROYER". Hull 104 (Neutronic refinery) is assigned
  picture 152, hull 105 (Merlin) gets picture 153. This removes typos in
  the original ship list, and ensures that the alchemy ships look different
  from the normal Super Transport Freighter -- but it can lead to confusion
  if an alternate ship list is used where slot 65 has nothing to do at all
  with `Topaz'. In addition, it does not correct the pictures of ships on
  the VCR and the ship build screen.

  For ship list designers, it may sound tempting to set the picture numbers
  for Merlin / NRS to 153/152 directly so that the ships look the same
  everywhere in Winplan. I do not recommend that; although this will work
  with Winplan, PCC and VPA, it will crash PLANETS.EXE and older PVCRs.


LANG.PLN - Host Language [V]
-----------------------------

  This file contains texts used in screen messages and messages sent to
  players from the Host. The file is required by THost 3.22.012 and later.
  The current version contains 990 records but not all of them are actually
  used. Probably the file size will change in the future.

 +0 100 BYTEs   unused
+100 990 RECORDs of 6 bytes each, describe the strings. This field is
                indexed from 1 onwards:
                 +0     DWORD   location of string in file, as usual "+1"
                 +4     WORD    Length of string
+6000 n BYTEs   the strings (raw data, no space padding here). The
                strings are not encrypted.

  Tim Wisseman supplies a program with source code to create/modify this
  file (PCKLANG1.BAS). The strings may contain carriage returns. Some use
  0Dh 0Ah as line feed character (screen messages), others use a single
  0Dh (subspace messages).


MISSION.INI - WINPLAN - Missions
---------------------------------

  This text file contains definitions for the "extended" missions that may
  be accessed via the M.I.T. window in Winplan. Each line of the file has
  the following format:

     000 Name (I:IntArg T:TowArg)*#/123456789ab

  000           is the mission number in ASCII, exactly the first 3 columns
                of each line are evaluated.
  Name          is the mission name shown in the selection lists.
  IntArg        name of Intercept parameter.
  TowArg        name of Tow parameter.
  *             if specified, the mission requires an Intercept parameter.
  #             if specified, the mission requires a Tow parameter.
  /123          if specified, the races that can use this mission. Default
                is that all can use it.

  The text in parentheses "(I:IntArg T:TowArg)" is syntactically part of
  the name, and therefore completely optional. Various clients, starting
  with VPA, use it to name the mission parameters. However, the need for
  parameters is solely defined by the "*" and "#" flags.


PLANET.NM - Planet names
-------------------------

  For each of the 500 planets a space-padded 20 character string.


PLNHELP.DAT - Help texts
-------------------------

 +0 600 BYTEs   100 Records of 6 bytes each
                 +0     DWORD   Address of text in this file + 1
                 +4     WORD    Length of text in bytes
+600  y BYTEs   Help texts

  This file has a similar structure as the message file (MDATAx.DAT). Only
  the "Count" field is missing, there are exactly 100 records.

  The texts are encrypted like the messages: Each ASCII code is increased
  by 13. Line ends are encoded as CR+LF (0Dh 0Ah, encrypted as 1Ah 17h).

  Unused help texts contain the text "RESERVED ... nn".


RACE.NM - Race names
---------------------

 +0  330 BYTEs  Long form of 11 names (30 chars): "The Robotic Empire"
+330 220 BYTEs  Short form of 11 names (20 chars): "The Robots"
+550 132 BYTEs  Adjective of 11 names (12 chars): "Robotic"

  Umlauts and other characters with a code >= 80h can be entered into
  RACE.NM using the NAMERACE program, but the Host replaces these
  characters with spaces in its Log files and messages. PLANETS.EXE simply
  omits these characters in most displays (there are no glyphs for these
  characters).


REG.KEY - WINPLAN - Registration Key
-------------------------------------

  (Read-only Information. I could give more information, but I don't want
  that every wannabe is able to fake his own reg-key...). Don't touch the
  other bytes.

   +0    50 BYTEs       Name of user
  +50    50 BYTEs       Address of user
                        These values are entered when registered WINPLAN is
                        run first after registering. Both are encrypted by
                        adding 13 to the ASCII codes.
 +150       DWORD       Signature
                        - 13: key is valid
                        - 666771: key is valid, but must be unlocked by
                          filling in the form displayed when WINPLAN is run
                          (above fields are invalid in this case).


RESOURCE.PLN - Pictures
------------------------

  File format information mostly by Frank Hempel.

  RESOURCE.PLN contains 151 images numbered from 1 to 151 (important if
  another file such as HULLSPEC.DAT references an image). Every picture
  consists of a 5537 byte record built up as follows:

 +0     WORD    Width of image, always 105
 +2     WORD    Height of image, always 93
 +4   n BYTEs   For each scanline 4 byte sequences. Each of the four byte
                sequences is ((Width+7) DIV 8) bytes long, in this case
                4x14 bytes. The first sequence contains information for
                color plane 0, bit 7 is the left-most pixel. Then the color
                planes 1 to 3 follow.
                This matches the organization of VGA video memory (the
                BASIC commands PUT and GET normally work with memory dumps,
                like here).
 +x   n BYTEs   unused
+5300 15 WORDs  Color palette. 5 records of 3 words:
                 +0     WORD    Red (0..63)
                 +2     WORD    Blue (0..63)
                 +4     WORD    Green (0..63)
                See also note below.
 +x   n BYTEs   unused. Non-existent for the last picture (#151).

  The Windows version doesn't use RESOURCE.PLN, the images are stored as
  single Bitmap files, as WINPLAN\BMP\VPLxx.BMP, xx is a 1- to 3-digit
  bitmap number. There are 262 images following this scheme, most are new
  planet pictures. See also WPVCR.DLL.

  Additionally, there are the WINPLAN\BMP\VPAUXxxx.bmp files. These are
  used when reading messages from 3rd-party programs, see MDATAx.DAT.


## Notes on the Color Palette

  Planets uses the 16 color mode of the VGA card. From these 16 colors, 11
  are fixed:

                Color   | Red   Green Blue      |
               =========|=======================|=============
                 0      |   0     0     0       | Black
                 6      |  37    18     3       | Red
                 7      |  42    42    42       | Light gray
                 8      |  20    19    22       | Dark gray 1
                 9      |   0     0    62       | Light blue
                10      |  12    55    12       | Light green
                11      |  17    17    17       | Dark gray 2
                12      |  58     0     0       | Light red
                13      |  11    11    11       | Dark gray 3
                14      |  60    59     0       | Yellow
                15      |  57    57    57       | White

  Colors 1 to 5 are defined by each image. In some pictures, e.g., the
  Merlin image, PLANETS.EXE shuffles the color components. This seems to
  be hardwired in PLANETS.EXE.

  For planets, PLANETS.EXE uses the palette to change the images. Desert
  planets appear in sand colors while arctic planets appear cold as ice.
  In pictures for factories, defense and mines the ground has the same
  color as the planet so that the buildings always stay on a different
  ground. See also the section on planets below.

  Some images may not use the special colors 1 to 5:
  - 8 (scanner), always combined with a ship image
  - 21, 48, 52, 71, 83, 93, 94, 115, 126, 138, 151 (Logo), always combined
    with a race member (main menu) or ship image (build screen)

  Images of ships or planets may not use colors 6 to 10. In VCR, where 2
  ships appear side by side, colors 1 to 5 of one ship are translated
  into colors 6 to 10, since a ship always needs the special colors.
  PLANETS.EXE doesn't do such translations, so that it needs to hide the
  planet picture by putting the scanner image (pic. 8) on it each time you
  request a visual scan from the planet or base screen.


## Assignment of the images

  All pictures not listed in the tables below are starship or planet
  images, see also HULLSPEC.DAT.

                  Race          | Logo   | Person | Fighter
                 ===============|========|========|=========
                  1 (Feds)      |   21   |   22   |   34

                  3 (Bird Men)  |   52   |   53   |   82
                  4 (Fascist)   |   71   |   70   |   82
                  5 (Privateer) |   83   |   75   |   80
                  6 (Cyborg)    |   93   |   91   |   92
                  7 (Crystal)   |   94   |   95   |   96
                  8 (Empire)    |  115   |  116   |  111
                  9 (Robot)     |  126   |  127   |  125
                  10 (Rebel)    |  138   |  139   |  130
                  11 (Colony)   |  151   |  150   |  145

                    Pic. | Meaning
                   ======|==========================
                      8  | Scanner Screen

                     51  | Explosion (VCR)
                     43  | unused planet picture

  A note on picture 30: This image is not used in HULLSPEC.DAT. Anyway, VCR
  uses it sometimes, see VCRx.DAT.


## Planet pictures

  To display a planet picture, the temperature and ID number are needed:
                INDEX := ( [Temperature_Value] + [ID_Number] ) MOD 13
  The Temperature_Value is the value stored in the planet record, not the
  Fahrenheit temperature. Each of the Index values maps to one planet
  picture:

                    INDEX | Planet Picture(s)
                   =======|===================
                      0   |    1
                    1..4  | 39 .. 42
                    5..7  |  2 .. 4
                    8..12 | 24 .. 28

  The palette (special colors 1-5) are computed separately.

  WINPLAN uses a different formula:
                INDEX := ID_Number MOD 95
  The index maps into a table of planet pictures:

                    INDEX | Planet Picture(s)
                   =======|===================
                      0   |     1
                    1..4  |  39 .. 42
                    5..7  |   2 .. 4
                    8..11 |  24 .. 27
                     12   |     43
                   13..62 | 155 .. 204
                   63..94 | 213 .. 244


SCRAM21.OLE - WINPLAN - Registration Protection
------------------------------------------------

  (Read-only Information. I could give more information, but I don't want
  that every wannabe is able to fake his own reg-key. Tim might not like
  this...)

 +178   311 DWORDs      VPH Array, Part A
+3710   311 DWORDs      VPH Array, Part B

  Only these both fields are important, SCRAM21.OLE doesn't contain
  information that couldn't be retrieved from other files. An important
  thing is that each SCRAM21.OLE needs to correspond with its REG.KEY,
  they are not interchangeable.

  Both values are required for MAKETURN. Index into the array is the
  current turn number, decremented by 311 until the result is a value in
  the range 1..311. `(VPH-ArrayA[X] XOR VPH-ArrayB[X])' gives the record
  `VPH_Record(X)'. Both values from this file are written to the TRN file,
  but are not necessarily identical to those of VPH35.DLL. Only the XOR
  result needs to be the same.


STORM.NM - Names for Ion storms
--------------------------------

  For each possible Ion storm (50 = IDs 1 to 50) 20 characters. Ion
  storms of the classes 1-3 (Ion Disturbances) get an ID number only.
  Strong Ion Storms get a name corresponding with the ID number.


TECH.MOF - Font
----------------

  TECH.MOF contains 96 characters, the ASCII codes 33 (21h) to 128 (80h).
  These character have a constant height of 16 and are 0 to 16 pixels
  wide. Each character is encoded as 16 WORDs, from top to bottom. Each of
  those has one bit set if the corresponding pixel is set. The least
  significant bit corresponds to the left-most pixel. The width of each
  character is defined by the right-most pixel. That's why the space
  character can't be encoded in this format and is handled separately.

  The characters 64 and 125 to 128 differ from Standard ASCII:

                  Code  | ASCII | TECH.MOF
                 =======|=======|===================
                   64   | @     | not displayable
                  125   | }     | Left arrow
                  126   | ~     | Up arrow
                  127   | DEL   | Right arrow
                  128   | C,    | Down arrow


TORPSPEC.DAT - Torpedoes [V]
-----------------------------

For each torpedo launcher (10) a record of 38 bytes:
 +0  20 BYTEs   Name
+20     WORD    Cost (mc for a Torpedo)
+22     WORD    Cost (mc for a Launcher)
+24     WORD    Tritanium needed for Launcher
+26     WORD    Duranium needed for Launcher
+28     WORD    Molybdenum needed for Launcher
+30     WORD    Mass of Launcher
+32     WORD    Tech Level
+34     WORD    Kill Value
+36     WORD    Damage Value

  Torpedoes always need 1 kt of each mineral to build and have a mass
  of 1 kt.

  The torpedo records are followed by 90 unused bytes.


TRUEHULL.DAT - Assignment Player <-> Starship Hulls
TRUEHOST.DAT - SRACE - Original TRUEHULL.DAT
----------------------------------------------------

  For each player (11) an array with 20 WORDs. Each WORD contains the
  number of a hull that the player can build (Index into HULLSPEC.DAT).
  These 20 "hull slots" correspond to the appropriate field in
  the starbase record.

  When a race can build fewer than 20 ship types, the last fields should
  be zero; there should not be zeroes between filled ship slots. Although
  Planets and Winplan can cope with that, most other client programs can
  not (tested with VPA, PCC and VPUtil).

  SRACE makes a new TRUEHULL.DAT reflecting the changed situation. In a
  game with, say, 11 Federations, TRUEHULL.DAT contains eleven equal
  records with 20 WORDs each. This file is used by client programs.

  The SRACE host uses TRUEHOST.DAT which is identical to the original
  TRUEHULL.DAT.

  PHost allows to choose an interpretation. Depending upon the
  MapTrueHullByRace setting, it expects an "SRace type TrueHull" (player
  1 uses record 1) or a "normal" one (if player 1 plays Lizards, he uses
  record 2).


VPH35.DLL - Version 3.5 Signatures
-----------------------------------

   +0       343 BYTEs   Useless bytes that try to fake a DLL.
 +343       311 DWORDs  Array 1
+1587       266 BYTEs   useless
+1853       311 DWORDs  Array 2
+3097         n BYTEs   useless

  Record VPH_Record(N) of VPH35.DLL is

         ( Array1[N] XOR Array2[N] ) AND 7FFFFFFFh

  N runs from 1 to 311. For larger values, counting starts at the
  beginning, that is 312 => 1, 313 => 2 etc.

  The values in the file seem to be random numbers. While the Task
  Manager from Windows 3.1, a 4 kB file, can be compressed by 55% using
  PKZIP, this file which is 5 kB and should offer more redundant data,
  can only be compressed to save 1%.

  THost will not run if it receives a Winplan TRN but can't open this
  file.


WPVCR.DLL - WINPLAN - Images for the Winplan VCR [T]
-----------------------------------------------------

  Another faked DLL. The file contains the monochrome counterparts for
  the ship images in the Bitmap files. There are ships flying to the
  left and ships flying to the right. These are used in the VCR.

--- Images ---
+1999           Here are the pictures addressed by the fields above. They
                are all complete 50x50 monochrome bitmap files. To display
                a picture, Winplan copies the image to TEMP.BMP and
                displays that file. It is a real BMP file that can be
                edited with Paintbrush.

TEMPLOCK.DAT
-------------

  11 DWORDs with TRN file checksums, or 0 if no TRN file. This file is
  only used during a MAKETURN run, you need not write it.


Static files
-------------

  The sum of all X coordinates of all planets in XYPLAN.DAT gives 998681.
  Maybe there is a Y checksum which must be 1002633. The sum of all bytes
  of BEAMSPEC.DAT, ENGSPEC.DAT, HULLSPEC.DAT and TORPSPEC.DAT gives
  338817, where the listed files need to have exact sizes.

  PHost generates 32-bit digests for these files, see under UTILx.DAT.


Other Files
------------

  The files SNOOKER.DAT, SCRAM21.OLE and VPH35.DLL may need to be read or
  changed, since they contain more protection functions. The TRN and RST
  files also contain checksums.


DATA OF 3rd PARTY PROGRAMS - CLIENT SIDE
=========================================

  A Pascal string is a byte giving the length of the string, and this many
  bytes following which contain the string itself. A fixed-size Pascal
  string is the same, but followed by some undefined bytes to pad the
  whole thing to a fixed size:

   "Hello" as Pascal string:       05 48 65 6C 6C 6F
           with fixed length 10:   05 48 65 6C 6C 6F xx xx xx xx xx
           (xx = undefined values)

  The description of the `.cc' files is the definition of these: this file
  is my personal reference for PCC.


AFSIM.SAV - AFSim - Saved simulation setup [T]
-----------------------------------------------

  This file contains a battle simulation saved in AFSim. Informer (a
  utility by the same author) can pass "real" situation in this format
  to AFSim.

 +0     WORD    Number of ships in the simulation
 +2  50 RECORDs of 54 bytes: ships in the battle
                 +0     BYTE    3 (Length of FCode)

                                by AFSim if the ship data is changed. When
                                exporting the battle from Informer, a
                                "real" ship name is stored here.

+2710   WORD    Starbase beam tech or 0
+2712   WORD    Number of starbase fighters
+2714   WORD    Defense on starbase

  Unused ship records are filled with FFh, except for the fields at offset
  4, 36 and 38. If there is neither a planet, nor a starbase playing, the
  last 14 bytes are 0.


.CCB - PCC, CCBSim - Battle simulations [V]
--------------------------------------------

  There are multiple versions of this file format.

    Format Version | Signature    | PCC Version | Bytes per Record
   ================|==============|=============|==================

          4        | "CCbsim3",26 |   1.1.11.6  |        65

  All PCC/CCBSim versions can read all older format versions, but only write
  the most current version. As an exception, 1.1.11.6 only writes version 4
  files when needed, otherwise it stays at version 3.

  Unused fields should be zero. Planets in a simulation currently are a
  horrible hack.

  Owner fields may be 12, for a totally "unspecial" race (Alien Marauders).

  Note that PCC 1.0.11 and higher permit to generate ships with Id numbers
  greater than 500. The maximum number of ships in a simulation is 100 in
  PCC 1.0.9 and earlier, and 200 in later versions.


CC.RES - PCC - Resources [V]
-----------------------------

  With this section I want to prevent that anyone tries to completely
  analyze my resource file...

 +0   2 BYTEs   Signature "RZ"
 +2     DWORD   File offset of resource directory
 +6     WORD    Number of entries in file


## Resource Directory

The RD contains a record for each entry of the file:
 +0     WORD    ID Number
 +2     DWORD   Location of entry in resource file
 +6     DWORD   Size of entry in bytes

  It is allowed to have multiple directory entry pointing to the same data,
  and there is no requirement that the entries be sorted in any way.


## The entries

  The entries in the file are identified by their ID number and are copies
  of other files that can have many different formats:
  - pictures
  - fonts
  - help texts
  - and the default specification files
  - some other files, intentionally undocumented, change without notice

  There are (almost) no type tags. When PCC finds a wrong type somewhere,
  it will likely crash. Some entries are compressed, some not.


## Compression

  PCC uses a simple RLE compression. Each compressed file starts with a
  DWORD specifying the length of the decompressed data. Then, the
  compressed file follows, split into chunks of the following format:

         +0     WORD    Uncompressed length of the following chunk
         +2     BYTE    Value used as prefix code in this chunk
         +3   n BYTEs   Compressed data. Either single bytes, or runs
                        encoded as `pp nn dd', where `pp' is the prefix
                        byte: this means, `repeat byte `dd' `nn' times'.

  The prefix byte may differ from chunk to chunk, however, most files only
  have one chunk. After the last chunk, a WORD with the value 0 must (!)
  follow.


## Pictures

  Pictures are stored in 3 formats; some are compressed using the above
  RLE scheme, some aren't. Here the description of the decompressed files.
  PCC will crash if it gets a compressed picture where it expects an
  uncompressed one, or vice versa, or a picture in the wrong format.

  RGB values range from 0 to 63. Not all pictures are allowed to use their
  private colors (for example, the three structures which are shown
  simultaneously on the Build screen must share one palette).


Format 1 (16 colors, always compressed):
 +0   2 BYTEs   Signature "CC"
 +2     WORD    Width
 +4     WORD    Height
 +6  15 BYTEs   Palette. 5 RGB triplets for color slots 10 to 14. Colors
                1 to 9 and 15 are fixed, see CHARTx.CC.
+21   n BYTEs   Bitmap data, from top to bottom, left to right. Two pixels
                per byte, the left pixel is in the lower nibble. If the
                width is odd, one half byte is wasted per line.

  Interesting pictures of this type are

                 Id             | Meaning
                ================|================================
                  201 .. 211    | Race persons
                 1001 .. 1153   | Starships, corresponding to
                                | RESOURCE.PLN entries 1 to 149,
                                | plus alchemy ships
                 4001 .. 4011   | Fighters
                 4601 .. 4610   | Torpedo blueprints
                 4701 .. 4710   | Torpedo launcher blueprints
                 4801 .. 4810   | Beam weapon blueprints


Format 2 (256 colors, always compressed):
 +0   2 BYTEs   Signature "CD"
 +2     WORD    Width
 +4     WORD    Height
 +6 192 BYTEs   Palette. 96 RGB triplets for color slots 192 to 255.
+198  n BYTEs   Bitmap data, from top to bottom, left to right.

  A 256-color picture Id (X) is automatically used as a replacement for
  16-color picture (X - 20000).


Format 3 (sometimes compressed):
 +0     WORD    0800h (Signature)
 +2     WORD    Width
 +4     WORD    Height
 +6   n BYTEs   Bitmap data, from top to bottom, left to right. Usually,
                the value 255 means a transparent pixel.


## Help Texts

  Help texts can be found at Ids 10000 to 19999 (help page Ids). They are
  normal ASCII texts with special control characters:

          1     (Ctrl-A) Followed by 2 ASCII characters: anchor (supported
                by PCC 1.0.6.1 and later)
          2     (Ctrl-B) At beginning of line, underlines (use only for
                page headings);
          3     (Ctrl-C) At beginning of line, centers the line;
          5     (Ctrl-E) Hide everything till end of line in graphics
                mode, print it in text mode (used for ASCII replacement
                of graphics in MAKEGLOS.EXE);
          7     (Ctrl-G) Followed by 6 ASCII digits. Graphics: the first
                digit specifies the segment of the image, the following
                five specify the image Id;
         10     (Ctrl-J) Linefeed;
         11     (Ctrl-K) Quote next character. Prevents special meanings
                of next character, in particular, prevent that a name
                in brackets is turned into a key-cap;
         16     (Ctrl-P) End of hyperlink;
         17     (Ctrl-Q) Begin of hyperlink. Followed by 5 ASCII digits
                (reference target). Hyperlinks can't contain linefeeds.
                PCC 1.0.6.1 and later supports an additional format where
                two ASCII characters and a colon precede the 5 ASCII
                digits, which automatically jumps to the named anchor
                (^Qab:10000Main^P = jump to anchor "ab" on page 10000);
         20     (Ctrl-T) Followed by an ASCII digit. Tabulator: ^T0
                moves to 40 pixels from the left, ^T1 to 80 pixels, and
                so on;

  Some printing characters give different symbols in PCC than on a
  standard codepage 437 text screen.


CHARTx.CC - PCC - Starchart entries [V]
----------------------------------------

  This file contains information on various things that are on the player's
  starcharts and are archived over a few turns.


## New Format [PCC 1.0.8+]

  The new starcharts file format is designed to be extensible, and to be
  parsable by a program which does not fully understand it. So it is
  divided into chunks, somewhat like UTILx.DAT.

Header:
 +0   8 BYTEs   Signature, "CCchart",26
 +8     WORD    Turn number
+10     WORD    Start of first data block (file offset, 0-based)
+12     WORD    Number of extra planet properties
+14     WORD    Number of extra starship properties
+n    n BYTEs   Names of extra planet properties
+n    n BYTEs   Names of extra ship properties

  By default, there is a planet property `COMMENT' and a ship property
  `COMMENT' declared. Users may declare more properties.

Blocks:
 +0     WORD    Type
                 1      Planet History (one per planet)
                 2      Ship History (one per ship)
                 3      Ship Track (one per ship; but see below)

  If existent, this record precedes a Painting record (type 5). It defines
  how Tag values corresponded to strings (atoms) when the file was written.
  Upon loading, PCC will modify the tags in the paintings accordingly.

  When CCMerge was used, there will be multiple Painting Tag records.
  Each of them only applies to the Painting record which follows.

+80     DWORD   Real Id number. If the Ufo represents some object which has
                its own Id number, this Id number is stored here. For
                PHost wormholes, this is the wormhole Id.

+86     WORD    X position where this Ufo was last seen
+88     WORD    Y position where this Ufo was last seen
+90     WORD    X movement per turn
+92     WORD    Y movement per turn
                PCC uses the last four fields to estimate the wormhole's
                current position.

  The file may end at any --- mark, depending upon which PCC version is

CMDx.TXT - Additional Commands [V]
-----------------------------------

  This file contains information to be transmitted to the host, which did
  not fit into the standard data files. Mainly, this is the PHost command
  processor commands, but not only those. Commands from this file are
  packed into the TRN by an appropriate MAKETURN program.

  At the time of this writing, this file format is supported by PCC and
  related programs, and VPA 3.61. It is more or less the result of a
  discussion on the phostdev mailing list; other program authors are
  encouraged to use this file format if possible.

  CMDx.TXT is a text file. Each line has the following format:
  - leading whitespace (ASCII 32) is ignored;
  - lines whose first non-blank character is a `#' are ignored (comments);
  - other lines contain PHost command processor commands which are sent
    as command messages verbatim. Unless specified otherwise below,
    the order of commands does not matter;
  - special commands starting with `$' are reserved for programs that
    read/write this file. Programs should preserve these commands.

  Programs should support both the Unix and the DOS linefeed convention
  (LF or CR+LF). Programs should support lines of at least 255 characters.

  The following special commands are defined at the time of this writing:

  - `$include FILE': this token is reserved to mean "include specified
    file here", but as of now it is not implemented;
  - `$send-file name.ext': generate a type-34 UTILx.DAT record (file
    transfer) which contains the specified file, and send it through the
    Host via TRN command 62 (SendBack). See there for further information;
  - `$time MM-DD-YYYYhh:mm:ss': specify the timestamp of the turn to which
    this file belongs. If present, this must be the first command in the
    file;
  - `$thost-allies ff1ee2FF3': (PCC) alliance settings for THost. The
    parameter is a sequence of 3-character alliance friendly codes, which
    are themselves not separated anyhow;


CPx.CC - PCC - PHost Command Processor Commands (obsolete) [V]
---------------------------------------------------------------

  This file contains information to be transmitted to the host, which did
  not fit into the standard data files. Mainly, this is the PHost command
  processor commands, but not only those. This file is never empty: if
  there are no such commands, it does not exist at all.

  PCC 1.0.6.3 and later are able to save commands in the standard message
  outbox (MESSx.DAT, MESS35x.DAT), so they can be seen in other clients.
  In that case, this file will only be used for the THost alliance command.
  PCC's MAKETURN will still use this file, so you can add commands to
  have them sent with the TRN.

  PCC 1.0.17 and later use the CMDx.TXT file format instead.

 +0   6 BYTEs   Signature, "CCcmd",26
 +6  18 BYTEs   Timestamp
+24     WORD    Number of commands (0..10000)
+26   n BYTEs   Records of variable length, the commands:
                 +0     WORD    "c" Command code
                 +2     WORD    "i" Integer argument
                 +4   n BYTEs   "s" String arg, Pascal string (<=43 chars)

  The limits for number of commands and the string argument length are the
  current limits of PCC and will be increased as the need arises. There
  can be at most one command with the same (command code, integer arg)
  pair.


## Commands

  Unused arguments are zero or empty. Command 12 is only generated in
  THost mode, all others only in PHost mode. Commands 7 and 8 are not
  yet generated by the PCC user interface, but supported by PCC's
  MAKETURN.

  + c=0, s=language name: "language" command;
  + c=1: "send config" command;
  + c=2: "send racenames" command;
  + c=3, i=1..3, s=name: change race name; i specifies component (1=full
    name, 2=short, 3=adjective);
  + c=4, s="yes" or "no": "filter" command;
  + c=5, i=player number, s=codes: "allies config" command. s contains
    alliance configuration codes, e.g. "~v +c";
  + c=6, i=player number, s="add" or "drop": "allies" command;
  + c=7, i=ship Id, s=stringified race number (e.g., "7"): give ship to
    specified race;
  + c=8, i=planet Id, s=stringified race number: give planet to race;
  + c=9, i=ship Id, s=remote control command ("control", "forbid", etc):
    configure remote control, or request/drop RC for allied ship;
  + c=10, s="forbid" or "allow": "remote default" command;
  + c=11, i=ship Id, s=codes: "beamup" command, s contains requested
    minerals;
  + c=12, s=codes: configure THost alliances. The string argument is a
    collection of control characters: bit 0..3 specify the race number,
    bit 6..7 is 00 (offer alliance), 10 (drop), or 01 (offer FF alliance;
    PCC 1.0.15+);
  + c=13: "send fcodes" command.


DISTTABL.DAT - Distance Table [V]
----------------------------------

  This file contains a look-up table to emulate the distance
  computations of HOST.EXE. Programs should use it to deliver exact
  predictions. See <http://phost.de/~stefan/fuelusage.html> for
  details. The idea is to compute 'Trunc(dx^2 + dy^2)'. HOST.EXE has
  some math errors here making it hard to duplicate its behaviour
  easily.

  The file consists of 168 "rows" corresponding to dy values from 1 to
  168. Each row consists of 21 bytes (168 bits) corresponding to dx
  values from 0 to 167. The low-order bit corresponds to the
  lower-valued dx. To compute the value 'Trunc(dx^2 + dy^2)', take the
  first dx bits in row dy, count the '1' bits, and add dy-1.

  If either dx or dy is negative, remove the sign; if dy is zero, swap
  dx and dy (for dx=dy=0, the result is obviously zero). HOST.EXE
  never plugs values larger than 162 into the fuel formula.


FLEETx.CC - PCC - Fleet Information [V]
----------------------------------------

  This file is located in the game directories and contains information on
  the player's fleets.

  Version 0 files are used by all versions of PCC, when a standard host
  (500 ships) is used. Version 1 files are only used with Host999 when
  there is a fleet with "high" members.

 +0   8 BYTEs   Signature "CCfleet",26
 +8     BYTE    Version number (0 or 1)
--- Version 0 ---
 +9 500 WORDs   fleet membership info, for all ships:
                 Bits 0..14     ID of the fleet the ship is in (0 = not in
                                a fleet). The fleet Id is the same as the
                                ship Id of the leader, so if the ship Id
                                equals the fleet Id, you're dealing with a
                                leader.
                 Bit 15         1 = there's a name for the fleet this ship
                                is leader of.
                If a ship not owned by the player is registered as a fleet
                member or leader, PCC will automatically correct the
                situation to account for the fact that the ship might have
                been destroyed.
+1009 n BYTEs   Names as Pascal strings. If a non-fleet leader has bit 15
                set, a string is read from the file, but immediately
                discarded.

+11   n WORDs   fleet membership info, same as above
 +?   n BYTEs   names


HULLSPEC.CC - PCC - Extended Hull Specification (obsolete) [V]
---------------------------------------------------------------

  This file is in the PCC directory and remains constant (in most cases).
  When using a custom universe, it may be changed and placed in the game
  directory. PCC will then use that file. HULLSPEC.CC contains a record of
  variable length for each hull (105). That records describe additional
  hull features. Note that this information is used only to display in the
  "Build Hull" section and ship mission screens ("Cloak"). They don't
  affect the real ship behaviour, the host uses its own information. It
  can lead to problems if a "normal" ship has the "Clock" bit set here,
  and the PCC interface is used to set the "Cloak" mission. It depends upon
  the host if the ship will cloak: older THosts will do it.

  If you use customized HULLSPEC.DAT and TRUEHULL.DAT, this file may be
  edited with CCSHIPS, or generated algorithmically using HULLGEN.

  This file is obsolete since PCC 1.1.12. Those get the short names
  from NAMES.CC, and read HULLFUNC.TXT / SHIPLIST.TXT for ship functions.

Each ship record has the following structure of variable length:
 +0   n BYTEs   Short name of the hull, a Pascal String of max. 12 chars.
                (for use in ship lists, e.g., "Nocturne")
 +n     WORD    Special capabilities of the hull:
                 Bit 0  Cloaking
                 Bit 1  Hyperdrive
                 Bit 2  Gravitonic Accelerators
                 Bit 3  Bio Scanner
                 Bit 4  Alchemy
+n+2  m BYTEs   Special capabilities that didn't fit into the above WORD, a
                Pascal string (e.g. "Chunnel"), for Alchemy ships a
                description of the reaction.

  format is not very well-explored, as I do not use Informer on a regular

MESSx.CC - PCC - Message-related Stuff (obsolete) [V]
------------------------------------------------------

  This file contains the template for messages from the appropriate player
  (the "signature"), and the "killfile" for incoming messages.

  This format is no longer used in PCC 1.1.5 and later in favor of
  MSGx.INI.

 +0 656 BYTEs   Message template. 16 fixed-size pascal strings with up to
                40 characters (16 x 41 bytes). For messages to a single
                player, this information is copied into the message text
                directly. Messages to more than 1 player have one line less
                (used for "CC: xxx" or "<<< Universal >>>"), so line 9 of
                the template is left out.
+656    WORD    Number of subjects in the killfile
+658  n BYTEs   Fixed-size pascal strings, 36 bytes each: subjects in the
                killfile (like in message overview)


MSGx.INI - PCC/VPA - Message Configuration [V]
-----------------------------------------------

  This file is used for the message template and for the filter entries.
  IT is used by PCC 1.1.5 and later, as well as VPA 3.61d and later.

  This is a text file, in standard ".ini" or "pconfig.src" file format.

  - "Filter = text": a message filter entry. Messages with the specified
    subject line are not displayed.
  - "Sig = text": add a line to the message template/"signature". This is
    currently ignored by VPA.


OBJx.CC - PCC - Objects in the starcharts (obsolete) [V]
---------------------------------------------------------

  NOTE: This file type is only documented here for historical reasons. It
  is no longer supported by recent versions of PCC. Since version 1.0, it
  exclusively uses the KOREx.DAT file format from Winplan. Do not use this
  file format.

  The file consists of several chunks of variable length. It ends with a
  block with all values 0. The file contains the unpacked version of the
  Winplan part of a RST file. Records that were empty in the Winplan file
  do never appear here.

 +0     WORD    Number of records in this chunk

PVIEW.NTP - PView - Notepad
----------------------------

  This file contains notes for object (notepad function). Addresses into
  the file use 0 as file start as usual. This file exists once per
  directory.

 +0 500 DWORDs  Addresses of notes for planets
    500 DWORDs  Addresses of notes for ships
     50 DWORDs  Addresses of notes for Ion storms
                The addresses are 0 if there is no note for that object
+4200 n BYTEs   Notes. Each note entry consists of 10 fixed-size Pascal
                strings with maximum length 40, so each note is 410 bytes
                total.


.SEL - PCC - Saved Selection [V]
---------------------------------

  These files contain saved selections, in a simple text format.

  + Line 1 has the form "CCsel0 <timestamp> <n>", where <timestamp>
    is the 18-place turn timestamp, and <n> is the number of saved
    selection layers in this file. Valid values for <n> are currently
    1 and 8. The timestamp can be a single dash "-" to turn off
    timestamp checking.

  + Following lines contain "p<id> <m>" or "s<id> <m>", where <id> is
    the planet/ship Id. <m> is a bitmask of layers where this object
    is marked, for <n> = 1 the only valid value is <m> 1, for <n> = 8,
    1 to 255 are allowed. Objects where <m> would be zero (not marked)
    are not stored.


STAT.CC - PCC - Statistics [V]
-------------------------------

  This file exists once per directory, even for more than 1 player. PCC
  expects all information coming from the same game, the original Planets
  also expects this. The scores from that player data are stored in
  STAT.CC and can be called on several places in the game.

 +0   8 BYTEs   Signature "CC-Stat",26
 +8     WORD    Number of entries in file

                 Bits 2..15     Reserved, set to 0
+10  12 BYTEs   Player teams. Each byte specifies for each player which
                team he is in. Team numbers range from 1 to 11. Player
                slot 12 has the constant team number 12, for handling the
                Alien Marauders.
+22  12 BYTEs   Reserved for team colors.
+34   n BYTEs   12 Pascal strings with team names.

                 Bits 3..7      reserved, 0
 +?     WORD    Passcode for Informer messages (0..9999)

  The data transfer settings may be missing (PCC 1.0.2), in this case they
  are considered to be all-zero (no passcode, no transfer enabled).


VMx.CC - PCC - Virtual Machine State [V]
-----------------------------------------

  This file contains the state of PCC's script interpreter for player x.
  Scripts which are suspended (`Stop') end up here, including auto tasks.
  You should understand how PCC's interpreter works before attempting to
  manipulate this.

  The file format consists of a header, followed by a sequence of code
  snippets, followed by a sequence of suspended processes.

Format of header:
 +0   4 BYTEs   Signature 'CCvm'
 +4  18 BYTEs   Timestamp
+22     BYTE    Signature 26 (^Z)
+23     BYTE    Format version (currently 0)
+24     WORD    Number of bytes following in header (currently 4)
+26     WORD    Turn number
+28     WORD    Player Id
--- end of header ---
+30   n BYTEs   Code snippets
 +x   n BYTEs   Processes

Format of a code snippet:
 +0     DWORD   Size of this record, not including this DWORD (0=last entry;
                then this is the only word in this snippet)
 +4     DWORD   "uid" Unique identifier. This code snippet is referenced
                by this number. This may be any bit pattern, there's no
                particular rule imposed on this (actually, PCC uses raw
                16:16 bit pointers here which are meaningless once PCC
                exits)
 +8     WORD    Minimum argument count
+10     WORD    Maximum argument count
+12     WORD    "nalloc" Number of allocated argument names
+14     WORD    "code" Total size of code in bytes
+16   n BYTEs   "Name hint". Pascal string with a subroutine name. Can be
                anything without very negative consequences. The VM loader
                uses this, the "nalloc" field and the argument names as
                a hint that this code snippet originally was the specified
                subroutine. This does *not* actually define the subroutine
                when the VM file is loaded, it only gives the loader the
                chance to save memory by merging identical code snippets.
 +x   n BYTEs   Argument names; "nalloc" names (see `Name List' below)
 +x   n BYTEs   Code. "code" bytes, a sequence of pascal strings.

Format of a process:
 +0     DWORD   Size of this record, not including this DWORD (0=last
                process)
 +4     WORD    "sp" Stack pointer (number of inactive code blocks)
 +6     WORD    "ctos" Context stack pointer. Specifies how many contexts
                this process entered, and thus must leave before
                terminating. The others were created by PCC before the
                process was started.
 +8     BYTE    Process status. Should be 3 (suspended).
 +9     BYTE    Process priority, 0 to 99. Low priorities run first.
+10   n BYTEs   Process name, pascal string (currently 45 characters max).
 +?   n BYTEs   Command sources. "sp+1" records of variable length, see
                below. A command source contains one or more commands that
                are to be executed.
 +?   n BYTEs   Contexts. Records of variable length, see below. At least
                "ctos" contexts, usually "ctos+2" or more.

Format of a saved command source (stack frame):
 +0     BYTE    Type of command source (0 or 1)
 +1     BYTE    Capabilities of this command source
                 0      "One"
                 1      "Stream"
                 2      "Random"
                Usually, type 0 command sources have the value 2 here,
                type 1 command sources have the value 0.
 +2     DWORD   Instruction pointer; index of next line to be executed
 +6     WORD    "nnam" Number of local variable names
 +8     WORD    "nval" Number of saved local variable values.
                The previous two words do not have any connection, there can
                be more names than values or vice versa.
+10   n BYTEs   Local variable names, "nnam" names (see `Name List' below)
 +?  6N BYTEs   Local variable values, "nval" records of 6 bytes each.
 +?   n BYTEs   String values.
                See CHARTx.CC, block 7/8, for details about the previous
                two fields.
--- Type 0 Command Source ---
 +?     DWORD   "ip" of first line in saved code snippet
 +?     DWORD   Code snipped identifier ("uid")
--- Type 1 Command Source ---
 +n   n BYTEs   Pascal string, line 0
 +n   n BYTEs   Pascal string, line 1 (must be a single command word, may
                be empty)

  Note: the variable value representation is optimized for size. It uses
  the fact that each Turbo Pascal Real that has the first byte zero can
  also have the second one zero without changing its actual value. This
  is a horrible hack -- this is what makes programming fun & challenging ;)

  Turbo Pascal Reals are 48 bits, where
   Bits 0..7    Exponent "e"
   Bits 8..46   Mantissa "f"
   Bit 47       Sign "s"
  The actual value is 0 if "e" is zero, or `sign * 2^(e-129) * 1.f' if
  "e" is nonzero ("sign" is +1 or -1 if "s" is 0 or 1, respectively).

  PCC will also read files with IEEE 32-bit floating point numbers, but
  it will never write them this way.

Format of a saved context:
 +0     WORD    Type. 0=last context, no information follows. All other
                contexts contain at least one (possibly unused) WORD.
                Values not defined here are reserved for the future; there
                is no way to load a saved context with an unknown number.

## Name Lists

  As of PCC v1.0.7, a name list is a sequence of Pascal strings (length
  byte + text), with a maximum identifier length of 31 characters. Valid
  characters in identifiers are capital letters, digits, `$', `.' and `_'.


VPAx.DB - VPA - Database [T]
-----------------------------

  This file contains history and other information of the VGA Planets
  Assistant. The file begins with a signature:

 +0  14 BYTEs   "VPA Database",13,10
 +14    BYTE    Database format version. Has the value 6 for all VPA
                versions in use nowadays (3.49+), and the text below
                describes format version 6.

  Then, for each turn, a block follows. It has the following structure:

 +0   4 BYTEs   Block name = "TURN"
 +4     DWORD   Size of data (counted from offset 116 onwards)
 +8     WORD    Turn Number
+10  18 BYTEs   Timestamp of turn
+28 11x4 WORDs  Scores (see GENx.DAT)
+116  n BYTEs   Data

  The Data block consists of several sub blocks containing various
  information:

 +0   4 BYTEs   Block name
 +4     DWORD   Total size of data (counted from offset 10)
 +8     WORD    "Count" Number of elements (=ships, planets, ...) in the
                block, if more than 1 are possible. 0 otherwise (e.g.,
                for PBPs).
+10 n   BYTEs   Data

  The following paragraphs describe the various sub-blocks in the file:

  + "BASE" - Starbase data
        Contains information on starbases (records as in BDATAx.DAT)

  + "EPLN" - Planet information
        500 records of the following structure, one per planet. The Count
        field is 500.
         +0     WORD    Turn of last scan, or 0
         +2     BYTE    Owner, or 0 if unknown
         +3     BYTE    Flags
                         Bit 7          Starbase exists
                         Bit 6          Starbase does not exist
                                        Both bits zero: not known
                         Bits 0..2      Industry level

                                        (the same as in PHost UTILx.DAT,
                                        plus one)

  + "IMSG" - Incoming messages
        Incoming messages kept in the database using the "Keep" command
        in VPA.MSG. The number of messages is in the "count" field in the
        block header. The data block contains a sequence of message headers
        followed by the texts. Message headers have the same format as in
        MDATAx.DAT:
         +0   DWORD     Offset
         +2   WORD      Length
        The offsets are relative to the position of the "count" word minus
        one. That is, when you copy the "count" word and the block data
        into a separate file, you get a standard MDATAx.DAT file.

  + "IONS" - Ion Storms
        Records of 22 bytes each:
         +0     WORD    Storm Id
         +2     WORD    X
         +4     WORD    Y
         +6     WORD    Radius
         +8     WORD    Voltage
        +10     WORD    Heading
        +12     BYTE    Warp
        +13     BYTE    1=growing, 0=weakening
        +14   4 WORDs   ? (-1, probably previous coordinates)

  + "MARK" - Markers
        Records of 12 bytes each, followed by comment texts
         +0     BYTE    Type (see data transmission, under MDATAx.DAT)
         +1     BYTE    Color
         +2     WORD    X
         +4     WORD    Y
         +6     WORD    Number of message (see "IMSG" block) of this
                        marker. 0 for user-made markers. Negative ship id
                        if bound to a ship.
         +8     WORD    Lines: X extent
                        Markers: position of comment text in text area
                        (1-based, 0=no comment)
        +10     WORD    Lines: Y extent
                        Circles: radius
                        Markers: text justification
        After the marker records, the text area follows. It is indexed
        1-based and contains the comments as Pascal strings.

        The field at +8 is not used for circle markers. VPA sets it to
        0 when it creates a marker, but preserves different values if you
        put them there (by editing the file). VPA10k uses this fact to
        mark its own markers and find them again later; it puts the
        value 4711 there.

        For more information on VPA markers, refer to the VPA data
        transmission section in the MDATAx.DAT description.

  + "MINE" - Mine fields
        Records of 16 bytes each (compare this to the minefield data
        transmission, which is the same except that the Id is missing):

        +10     DWORD   Mine units
        +14     WORD    1=Web mines

VPAMSGx.DAT - VPA - Message Information [T]
--------------------------------------------

  This file contains associations between messages and objects, as parsed
  from MDATAx.DAT. This is just what I found from some small samples, and
  seems to be rather intrinsic to VPA.

 +0   n DWORDs    For each message from MDATAx.DAT:
                   Bits 0..10   Object Id (0..2047)
                   Bits 11..14  Object Type:

                                0001 if message is associated with a planet
                                0010 if associated with a ship
                                0011 if associated with a minefield

                   Bits 16..?   associated VCR number or 0 (?)
                  E.g., a `(-d0167)' message has the value 08A7h here,
                  where A7h = 167 is the planet/starbase Id, and bit 11
                  is set to tell this message belongs to a planet.
 +?   n WORDs     For each message in the VPA database, "IMSG" block
                  (messages that will be kept): position of this message
                  in MDATAx.DAT, 1-based.

AUXHULL.DAT - VPEdit/VPHost - Auxiliary Hull Data [T]
------------------------------------------------------

  This file can be edited with VPEdit. VPHost 3.16 claims to use it
  to define auxiliary hull information, but this seems not be true.
  This file assigns special abilities to ships. So far, this mechanism was
  never implemented completely. Just for curiosity, here it is.

  The file contains one record per hull, each of which is 32 bytes.

                A turn ends with a block of type 0 containing no data, i.e.
                just a null byte. Each block specifies the differences
                from the previous turn to this one.

  Note that the VPM player assumes that the first recorded turn is turn 1,
  no matter what it really was.


FILE LIST - WHO OWNS WHAT
==========================

  This section contains a list of files, not all of which are documented
  here, with brief information on who uses them. This is useful from time
  to time when digging through game directories sent with bug reports.
  Files marked [*] have descriptions here. Obvious names have usually been
  omitted (i.e. `echoview.ini'). This list is expected to grow.

  "Standard" means that every nontrivial program handles this file.

FIELD LIST - WHAT IS STORED WHERE
==================================

  In many cases, properties of a single object are scattered through
  many places. This table attempts to aid you in finding what you
  need. Most important properties and files are listed, some
  unimportant or obsolete ones have been left out.

  Much information is transported in messages. In general, when you're
  looking for the status of an object, you'll find it in some data
  file (and thus in this table). When you're looking for a report
  about some action (like "minefield laid" or "planet conquered"), you
  should look for messages or UTILx.DAT entries.
