      <para>Ships on starchart are shown as little triangles, they're
      blue if the ships are our own, and red if not. This triangles
      are oriented specially to show the actual ship's heading, so you
      can be aware of that even without the need of selecting every
      ship.</para>
      
      <para>To select a ship you should right-click near it, the right
      panel switches to <emphasis>ship list mode</emphasis>, and show
      a complete list of every visible ship on the same spot,
      similarly to <xref linkend="fig_starchart-ship-simple"/>,
      drawing a green mark around the selected location.</para>

      <para>On the list you'll see the ship's ID and name, and
      selecting any of this list items will update the information
      below, showing a limited but vital set of ship data. If you
      double-right-click on the starchart, or double-click on the ship
      list, the extra panels will appear showing the rest of the
      ship's data and the corresponding ship image, just like <xref
	  linkend="fig_starchart-ship-complete"/>.</para>
