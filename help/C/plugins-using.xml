  <title>Using plugins</title>

  <para>&app; has a special menu for plugins, where the active plugins
  can make accessible its features. When a game is first created, only
  the Plugin Navigator will be active, you can then activate the rest
  with it.</para>

  <para>The <emphasis>Plugin Navigator</emphasis> is the graphical
  frontend of the plugin manager, a piece of software that manages all
  available plugins for &gwp;. As you can see on <xref
  linkend="fig_plugin-navigator"/>, the Plugin Navigator shows the
  list of available plugins so that you can click on the toggle button
  on the left to activate or deactivate as necessary.</para>

  <para>When activated, a plugin can register its actions in various
  forms, for example: it can register some action to be done when you
  press some keystroke, or when a specific event is received, or even
  when you select the action from the Plugins menu. Each plugin will
  have its own kind of behaviour.</para>

  <para>When closed, &app; will remember the list of active plugins
  and will activate them at game load, so you don't have to.</para>

  <para>If you want to add some plugin to &app;, you simply have to
  create the <filename class="directory">~/.gwp/plugins/</filename>
  directory, and place it there, it'll added to the Navigator on the
  next execution.</para>
