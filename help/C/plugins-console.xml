  environment. This is why &gwp; has a Python, you can access it by
  selecting <guimenuitem>Python console</guimenuitem> on the

  <para>As you see on <xref linkend="fig_python-console"/>, you have
  available the <emphasis>gwp</emphasis> module, where you have listed
  all the classes and functions to write your plugins. As the plugin
  support is a work-in-progress feature, the plugin API will surely
  change, nevertheless it's in a semi-stable state.</para>

  <para>It's necessary to say that the python console is not an
  original work from &gwp;'s development team, it was copied from the
  Dia Project and adapted to our environment.</para>
