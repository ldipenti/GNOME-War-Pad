      <title>About the program</title>

      <para>&app; is a <emphasis>VGA Planets</emphasis> client for the
	  GNOME platform. This project's objectives are to produce a
	  full-featured client, easy to use by new players but
	  powerful enough for experienced VGA Planets emperors.</para>
      
      <para>Since version 0.3.3, it features the capacity to run small
      Python programs as plug-ins of the main application, this will
      enable the users to customize their own functionality without
      having to wait for those features to come on the program
      itself. A &gwp; Plugin Programming Manual will be available as
      soon as the API stabilize a little, in the meanwhile is you are
      interested in writing your own plugins, you can look at the
      existing ones.</para>

      <para>The final version of this program should include the basic
	  gaming capability, plus a good pack of statistical charts,
	  estimation tables and graphs and calculus dialogs.</para>
    
      <para>&gwp;'s user interface is being designed so
	  that most activities are centered around the
	  <emphasis>starchart</emphasis>, this way the player can keep a
	  global vision of the territory. For the UI design I took ideas
	  from various VGA Planets clients, such as Informer, VPA and
	  PCC, nevertheless GWP has its own unique style, as a result of
	  the blending of the best characteristics of such clients plus
	  some of my own ideas (and some of my friends ideas
	  too!).</para>
