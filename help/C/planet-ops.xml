      <para>Each planet is represented by a tiny circle, if it's
	grey the planet is unknown, if it's green, the planet is
	ours. Planets with a green <emphasis>halo</emphasis>, are
	planets that have starbases orbiting, so that you can identify
	them quickly.</para>

      <para>As you can see on <xref linkend="fig_starchart"/>, when
	you click on a planet, a little red mark is placed around the
	selected planet and the most important data about that planet
	appears on the bar at the right. The idea of this is that you
	have only the important data with a fast, single-click on each
	planet. If you want more detailed information about the
	planet, just double-click on one, and two extra panels will
	appear, like the ones on <xref
	linkend="fig_starchart-planet"/></para>
      
      <para>At this mode, you can see all the data about the
	selected planet, and the starchart centers around the selected
	planet so you can see it sorroundings. You should note that
	the starchart scrolling functions are disabled in this view
	mode, you can return to full starchart view hitting the
	<keycap>Esc</keycap> key, or double-clicking on the planet
	again.</para>
      
      <para>On the lower left panel, there's a table with planet's
	future information, based on its actual state, this is very
	useful to establish long term strategies, this panel is
	intended to contain more and more of this type of charts,
	graphs, etc.</para>
