  <para>Every player has its own tastes about what a good &vgap;
  client should have as a feature, so it's impossible to write a
  good client for all of us. From the beginning, &gwp; was started to
  be client that will provide basic functionality in a friendly way to
  novice &vgap; players, and will provide customization capabilities
  to veteran ones.</para>

  <para>The plugin system enable any player with programming skills to
  write his or her own piece of functionality and add it to the whole
  &gwp; in a very integrated way. For this to happen, the Python
  interpreter was embedded on &appname;, Python is a well known
  interpreted and object oriented, programming languaje, used and
  supported by a huge community on the Internet.</para>

  <para>&appname;'s planets, ships, starchart, user interface, etc. is
  accessible by the plugin interpreter so the plugin writer will
  manipulate those entities as objects, in a very natural way. Also,
  game and key events are forwarded to the plugins so that they can
  take action if neccesary.</para>

  <para>In short, the plugin system is made for you to customize your
  own &appname;, and to share those customizations with your
  friends. If you make a cool plugin, you can <ulink
  url="mailto:lucas@lunix.com.ar">send it to me</ulink>, and I'll
  check if it can be added to the default distribution.</para>
