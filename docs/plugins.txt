                        - GWP PLUGIN INTERFACE -
                        ------------------------

The Python plugins will need to be placed on ~/.gwp/plugins/
directory.

The active plugin list needs to be saved per game, so that race or
add-on specific plugins can be loaded as needed. For this feature
we'll have to write a plugin activation/deactivation dialog.

Plugin registering process:
--------------------------
* Plugin name.
* Plugin version.
* Plugin author (name <email@some.host.com>).
* Plugin short description. (1 line)
* Plugin long description.
* Plugin license.
* Hooks to connect to.


Plugin hooks:
------------
* A preset list of callbacks (UI events, system events).
* Function keys (F1, F2, ...).
* Hotkeys (Ctrl-A, Alt-N, ...).


UI Integration:
--------------
* Menu item with plugin's name as its label.
* Toolbox, with one category per plugin, like glade.
* Pop-up menus (on different parts of GWP's UI).
* GWP provides empty panes where the plugins can add their own UI. The
  user will choose to view the default UI or the plugin one, by
  selecting the right tab.
* For plugins that activate some feature on selected planets/ships, it
  should exist a 'notification area' on the main info panel. This
  notification area should not be hidden when other plugins add new
  panes for their own UI. The data that should be shown there could be
  a simple icon or letter that will show a tooltip or popup window
  with the feature configuration or brief description when the mouse
  passes over.
