message-reader:

[  X][B][-] message-counter gets confused when selecting messages
            directly and using the next/prev buttons
[  X][r][n] always highlight the displayed message
[  X][r][-] pre-sort messages to avoid multiple identical message categories
[   ][r][n] add a message counter to every category
[   ][r][n] try to create a significant subject for every message
[   ][r][n] try to use colourified messages according to their importance
[   ][r][n] expand/collapse categories with double-click
