[I][T][S]
I = Importance: "   " - nice to have (program/part improvement)
                "  X" - needed       (program/part usable without)
                " XX" - essential    (program/part not usable without)
                "XXX" - urgent       (program/part crashing, insecure, ...)
T = Type:       "r"   - request
                "B"   - bug
S = Status:     "-"   - done
                "n"   - will be one of the next things to do
                "d"   - delayed, eg. to the next version

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

message-reader:

[  X][B][-] message-counter gets confused when selecting messages
            directly and using the next/prev buttons
[  X][r][n] always highlight the displayed message
[  X][r][-] pre-sort messages to avoid multiple identical message categories
[   ][r][n] add a message counter to every category
[   ][r][n] try to create a significant subject for every message
[   ][r][n] try to use colourified messages according to their importance
[   ][r][n] expand/collapse categories with double-click

starchart:

[ XX][B][n] Some minefields are not being showed.
[  X][B][-] When unpacking with GWP, some ships appear on starchart
            but when clicking on it, the ship list is empty.

race related:

[XXX][B][-] Use a function that return the race *character*, from 1 to
            B...not from 1 to 11. I think players with race 10 and 11
            are not being able to use GWP.

unpacker:

[  X][B][n] Need to detect winplan/dosplan style RSTs, to unpack or
            not KOREx files, etc.
